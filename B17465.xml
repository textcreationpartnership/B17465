            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am very sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that my indisposition cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyn'd mee, and to bee my selfe the Bearer of the Booke which I send you. Yet since you receive it from better and more worthy hands then mine, and that <hi>M.</hi> the Bishop of <hi>Nantz</hi> hath done mee the honour to carry it, I need not fear it should run any hazard in my absence.
<pb facs="tcp:205168:4"/> If the King vouchsafe to cast his eyes upon it for the testimony you beare it, I dare promise <hi>my Lord,</hi> that he will finde some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that will please him for the remembrance of what is pass'd, and that his vertue being without example, he will take pleasure to see that I speake thereof after a manner which is not altogether common. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test freely that the considerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of so high a vertue, hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me thoughts which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect from the mediocrity of my wit: and I have bin so extraordinarily transported, that oftentimes I knew not what I was about to write. It alone, hath discovered to mee the <hi>Idaea</hi> of this Art which commands all others, which excites and calmes the passions
<pb facs="tcp:205168:5"/> as seemeth good to it; which is not content to please by the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Style, and the graces of language, but which under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to perswade by the force of learning and abundance of reason. I have sought it hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to unprofitably; the Life of the King hath taught me more then all the precepts of the <hi>Rhetori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians;</hi> and I owe all the merit of my work to the happinesse of his raigne. It is at least one advantage which I have above those who have lived before me. Their memory is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes venerable to mee; and since I honour men of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score yeares, I have no mind to contemne the Antiquity of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Generations. For strangers that believe themselves to have the possession of wit, we are not
<pb facs="tcp:205168:5"/> bound to yield them the same respect; and I think I may say without offence, that as they have not a Master of so much worth as ours, neither would it be reasonable for us to be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to them; and that the worthiest <hi>Prince</hi> of the world should command a people of lesse worth then others: In my opinion you will state this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion in our Favour: But I hope more <hi>My Lord,</hi> if you take notice of the carriage of the discourse, and consider how I get out of ill passages, you will do me the honour to avow, that though I walk upon thornes I am not prick'd, and that in the most dangerous matters I have kept that temper which ought to be held <hi>Inter abruptam audaciam, &amp; deforme obsequium:</hi> Between
<pb facs="tcp:205168:6"/> presumptuous boldnesse and deform'd flattery. If sometimes I have most free expressions, me thinkes my Libertie is like that of well polliced Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes, where they leave not off to obey the lawes, and together withall to preserve their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
            <p>When I shall be at <hi>Milan</hi> or at <hi>Brussels,</hi> I shall not know how to handle the <hi>Princes</hi> of the house of <hi>Austria</hi> with more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect and reverence then I doe; and it is in my opinion all that they can expect from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scretion of a man that is not their Subject. For not to dare to speak of the Ambition of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> of the Maximes of the <hi>Counsell</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> and of the Designe to conquer, which the King will change when he shall
<pb facs="tcp:205168:6"/> please, into a necessity of defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding themselves; would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready one beginning of slavery which wee should pay them; and they are, I assure my selfe, too just to be willing that wee should thanke them for the wrong they have done us.</p>
            <p>There may be some other passages which ill Interpreters will wrong in the explication, chiefly where it is spoken of <hi>Ministers</hi> and Favourites: But keeping my selfe in generall Thesise's, and not designing the persons in particular, my proceeding seemes to mee very innocent. Neither can I hinder those that find themselves guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to have remorse, or that wounded faces should not see their scarres when they behold themselves in a glasse. If it were
<pb facs="tcp:205168:7"/> forbidden to make profession of Truth, I should not present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turne Rebell, nor oppose my self to an established order: I would obey so perverse a Law, because I am a good Citizen, but it should be by my silence, and not by my cowardlinesse, and at the charges of not speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all, but not of speaking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst my conscience. God be thanked, we are not upon these tearmes; and I also injoy the good fortune of the times, and knowing well, that whatever falls out, servile spirits are su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected, that their Testimony is not received, and that they do injury to Reason it self when they make use thereof, I would be bold sometimes, to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible alwayes, and to make that passe for absolute Truth, which
<pb facs="tcp:205168:7"/> otherwise might be disputed.</p>
            <p>There are that accuse mee of a contrary vice, and who say that I flatter because in some places I strive to adorn truth: I would not do an ill office to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny person; But assure your self, <hi>my Lord,</hi> that these kind of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are Enemies rather of my Subject, then of my Book, and wish more against the <hi>Prince,</hi> then against the Oratour. I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, had I bin able to expresse my self in a loftier strain, I could have made it appeare in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion; neither had it beene as was sometime said to imploy the Arrowes of <hi>Philoctetes</hi> to kill birds, nor to raise stormes upon a Rivulet: It is not fit to speake meanly of that which is the highest next under Heaven, and Soveraignty which is ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb facs="tcp:205168:8"/> all alone, deserves without doubt a double veneration when it hath vertue for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion. One cannot write of the King in tearmes too high nor too magnificent; and wee may for many just reasons al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him that, which heretofore hath been conferr'd upon wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Princes</hi> meerly in respect of their <hi>Character.</hi> I will not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present you <hi>My Lord,</hi> with what honour and what humility, or rather with what worship and religion the <hi>Romane Princes</hi> have been entertained by their Subjects. I will not trouble my selfe to make you consider that they bestow'd upon them <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>Divinity;</hi> as wee give our <hi>Soveraignes, Majestie</hi> and <hi>Highnesse,</hi> that what is now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Crime of Felony,</hi> was in
<pb facs="tcp:205168:8"/> those times called the <hi>Crime of Impiety,</hi> and that our Rebels were their Ungodly ones.</p>
            <p>I will not alleadge that in the <hi>Code</hi> of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers of the Emperours are sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Oracles; their Edicts Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Letters, their Aspects a Celestiall splendour, their Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, the Divine House, their Closet the Sanctuary: I onely intreat you to remember that this Style is the Style of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane</hi> Empire, which had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy received Christianity, and that not only the Courtiers and the Oratours have spoken thus, but also the Holy Fathers and the Councels. Saint <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> in his first Invective against <hi>Julian,</hi> calleth <hi>Constance</hi> most Divine <hi>Prince,</hi> though this most Divine <hi>Prince</hi> had perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb facs="tcp:205168:9"/> the faithfull, driven the Popes out of their Seate, and dyed in the <hi>Arrian</hi> Heresie. <hi>Anastasius</hi> was also an Heretick Emperour, and was slain with a Thunderbolt by a just punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Heaven; and yet <hi>Sabas</hi> the good servant of God speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this wicked <hi>Prince,</hi> said, that he was come to adore the steps of his Imperiall Piety: and an Historian of his time called him Saint <hi>Anastasius.</hi> The Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the sixth Councell of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> do call <hi>Justinian,</hi> Saint <hi>Justinian,</hi> and his Wife Saint <hi>Theodora,</hi> though the Life of both of them was fuller of <hi>Monsters,</hi> then of <hi>Miracles,</hi> and that <hi>Theodora</hi> particularly made use of the power of the Empire onely to doe mischiefe to the Church: After the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb facs="tcp:205168:9"/>
               <hi>Theodorick</hi> the <hi>Arrian</hi> is called Saint <hi>Theodorick</hi> by the Councell of <hi>Rome,</hi> and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the relation of <hi>Eusebius; Dennis</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr of our <hi>Lord,</hi> gave the Title of most Holy, to <hi>Valerian</hi> the <hi>Pagan</hi> Emperour, though wee attribute it now only to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame Head of Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p>Now if this be so, and that the Fathers and the Councels have spoken of the holinesse of <hi>Heretiques</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> which proceeded only from the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and unction which they received, and which conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently was externall and came from without; why is it not lawfull for me to acknowledge another holinesse joyned to this? a Holinesse which is not
<pb facs="tcp:205168:10"/> superficiall and borrowed; but which hath its foundation in the innocency of life; which is not tyed to the Dignity, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in the Person; which is not an impression of the finger of <hi>God</hi> upon a fortuitous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but an effusion of his grace in a soule chosen and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destin'd. Whoever finds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in my words, knowes not what is the duty of a Subject, nor has that opinion which he ought to have concerning his own <hi>Prince.</hi> He carries his sight too boldly upon so elevated a greatnesse, and measures not the distance which is betweene his Judgement and the worth of the King. Provided that the honour which is rendered to these Sacred Persons be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to <hi>God,</hi> there can be no
<pb facs="tcp:205168:10"/> excesse in honouring them; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the Praises which are given them, do not offend a greater <hi>Majestie</hi> then theirs, they cannot be immoderate; wee ought to reverence even their shadow, &amp; bow the knee before their picture: All that comes near them ought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to us more pure, and more full of luster by the participati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it receives from their rayes. The respect which is born them ought to proceed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to their Liveries and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Servants, and with grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reason to be extended to their Affaires and <hi>Ministers:</hi> For whom you may remember if you please, that the ancient Christians were wont to pray publikely, and to ask of God their preservation, though thereby they intreated for the
<pb facs="tcp:205168:11"/> preservation of their persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and of those who exposed them daily to Lions in the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheater.</hi>

            <p>After this Example I have no mind to murmure against the Government of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, nor to find fault with that which passeth over my head. I am alwayes content with the present honesty, and the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which is in use; I never dispute against the Pilote that carries me, nor am curious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a novelty, to which, though it may chance prove good, I shall have much trouble to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>custome my selfe. I suffer Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, and desire the upright administration of Justice: When my Superiours are froward and perverse, I have docility and patience; when they are such
<pb facs="tcp:205168:11"/> as they ought to be, I have thankfull acknowledgement, &amp; love. To those that are bad I give my silence and discretion, but neither do I forbeare to speak well of those that are good, nor to praise things that are praise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. For what concernes you, <hi>My Lord,</hi> I know that you endeavour more for the solidity of vertue, then for its pompe, and that you had rather fight, then triumph. Yet since your modesty is such, that it often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times rejects truth, you ought not to be believed in your own cause, and I lawfully except a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you. Your Moderation must not hinder our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement, nor must wee be ungratefull, because you are shamefast. It is true, there are certaine bounds within
<pb facs="tcp:205168:12"/> which the most violent affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought to containe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and because I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to quote Latine, I will owe you that saying of <hi>Tacitus, Pessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum Inimicorum genus Laudan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes:</hi> Praysers are the worst kinde of Enemies. But communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to no other what is due to the King alone, nor bestowing the honour of successes else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; they cannot take it ill that I represent you as a wise and faithfull <hi>Minister,</hi> that acts by the orders and commands of a great <hi>Prince,</hi> and who seeks for no other glory but that of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beying and serving well. Men need not be astonished, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong so many unjust passions and groundlesse murmurings, there are found free judgements and voices that blesse your car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb facs="tcp:205168:12"/> of businesses. And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, in a time when you are so powerfully and so violently assaulted, there would be a want of the duties of humanity not to study to finde out some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation for your displeasures, and to see an Innocent suffer without giving him one sigh, or comforting him with one word. It is not enough, <hi>My Lord,</hi> that you are assur'd of the Protection of your <hi>Master,</hi> and of the good state of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, you have still need of the opinion of men, and of the Testimony of the Publicke. You apprehend not the danger of your Person, nor the ruine of your fortune, but you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend blame, and evill repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; You are afraid of disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest things though you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne
<pb facs="tcp:205168:13"/> dangerous ones. And therefore this ought to bee a sweet sadnesse, and a misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which you may stile glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious; to know, together with all good men, that you suffer for Justice, and that your cause is that of the <hi>King,</hi> and of the State. If it grieves you that you are not in the favour of a great Princesse, at least you have not any remorse for being unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to her; and if you have not had complacencie enough to performe all her desires, wee know that you have too much honesty to have done any thing against her service. It is no small comfort to your mind, that the taking of <hi>Rochell,</hi> where you did most profitable service; and the reliefe of <hi>Cazal,</hi> to which you contributed very much, are
<pb facs="tcp:205168:13"/> the onely Crimes which make you guiltie; and that the luster of what you have done abroad being not able to be supported at the Court, strangers are come to mingle themselves in this domestick Jealousie, and to try to ruine him, whom they could not gain.</p>
            <p>This is the fountaine of our last evils. The Credulity of the best Queene in the world hath serv'd for an innocent Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the malice of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the Request she made to the <hi>King,</hi> to remove you from his affaires, was not so much an effect of her indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion against you, as the first blow of the Conspiracie framed against <hi>France,</hi> and which was disguis'd to her under the vaile of devotion, that she might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb facs="tcp:205168:14"/> she merited in ruining you. The King would have given her all the reasonable satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction hereupon that shee could desire. Hee was many times your Advocate, and Interces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour towards her: Hee would have bin your surety, and have answered for your fidelity. On your part <hi>My Lord,</hi> you have forgot nothing wherby to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to asswage her spirit; she hath seene you at her feete asking her favour, though you might have demanded justice: she hath seene you make your selfe guilty and wronging your owne Innocency to give her place to pardon you. You have put your selfe in all postures of duty to move her, and if she would have believed no body but her selfe you had prevail'd
<pb facs="tcp:205168:14"/> with her: But those evill spirits which environ'd her, and who more desired your destruction then her contentment, made new batteries, thereby to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den her heart, which began to be mollified: They hindered the effect which wee expected from your submissions and from the Kings intreaties, they wrought upon her good disposition which began to yeeld and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and had it not beene for their devilish slights we should have seen her full of glory and Majestie, bearing a part in all the thoughts of her Son; and wee should see you again receiving ordinarily from her mouth the commands of your Master: But she disrellisheth the one and the other, and will remain still in her former perswasion. The
<pb facs="tcp:205168:15"/> King, who hath granted her the pardon of more then forty thousand guilty persons, could not obtain from her the favour for one Innocent; and hee that is come to the end of the obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacie of the Rebels, nor hath undertaken any thing without successe, hath petition'd his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to no purpose. This made Him oppose a necessary constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy against so strange a resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to resolve not to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure his Enemies with the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of his servants. Hee retain'd you then, when you press'd him to give you leave to retire; and being ready to yeeld to the times, and to give place to envie, hee made it appeare that he was stronger then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and that he could change the time when he pleas'd: Hee
<pb facs="tcp:205168:15"/> did not believe that hee offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Nature not to abandon ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, nor that it was a sin against maternall Duty, not to violate friendship: and remembring perhaps that our Lord called his disciples his Mother and his Brethren, and said in the same place, <hi>That he that doth his will, the same is his Brother, and Sister, and Mother,</hi> He consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that Kings ought not so to respect Proximity, as to make no account of affection; and that to raigne, they have indeed need of Alliances and Kindred, but neither must they let passe servants and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Behold then your selfe, <hi>My Lord,</hi> maintain'd by the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of your Services, and the Interests of State, behold your
<pb facs="tcp:205168:16"/> selfe above the winds and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests. The complaints made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst you have onely assured your <hi>Master,</hi> that you are more to him then they could desire; The blow wherewith they thought to make you fall, serv'd onely to set you the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, and that force which gave the shock to your fortune, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being able to shake it, shew'd us the solidity of its matter. Neverthelesse being good and vertuous as you are, I imagine you are not content with this Fortune if you pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesse it not with the consent of the whole world: It cannot be more powerfull and more firm then it is, but it may be more sweet and delightfull. You ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver received so great honours, but you have tasted purer joyes:
<pb facs="tcp:205168:16"/> Never were there more victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries nor more advantages over the Stranger, and never more intestine mischiefs and tumult in the House. This disorder which you have no way caus'd greatly afflicts you, and I know you would with all your heart that every thing were in its place. I doubt not but you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waile the misfortune of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse whom you have condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by your Services to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most degree of felicitie, and that having laboured so long and so affectionately the perfect Union of their Majesties, it is a sensible displeasure to you at this day to see your labours ruin'd, and your worke fallen to the ground: You would be willing I assure my selfe, you had dyed at <hi>Rochel,</hi> because till
<pb facs="tcp:205168:17"/> then you were in the Queenes good opinion. I believe amidst the complaints that she makes, all the praises that come to you from elsewhere are importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and that even your merit is in some sort odious to you, since it hath not her approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. God will dispell one day these clouds, and will send her more upright thoughts of your fidelitie.</p>
            <p>But expecting till this bee brought to passe, and that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses receive some accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation, it shall not trouble you if for some houres I turne your eyes from these sad ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which afflict you, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent you with the Image of a happier season then this here present. I thinke I am inspir'd by my good Angel to bound
<pb facs="tcp:205168:17"/> my design with the first voyage for <hi>Italy;</hi> Before, <hi>My Lord,</hi> that your prosperitie was envied, that your friends fail'd of their fidelitie, that the Queene had changed her affections, and that the exploits of the Armie were weakened by the close dealings of the Closet. I meddle not with these hatefull Subjects, nor have the heart to handle wounds so fresh and bleeding. I will onely speak of what hath preceded our miseries, and in all this I will onely warrant my intention. It is very good, <hi>My Lord,</hi> and hath nothing for its object but the service of the <hi>King,</hi> but perhaps it is ill ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, and arrives not whither it tends. I know I am a good <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and extreamly love my Countrey; but I know not
<pb facs="tcp:205168:18"/> whether I am a good Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, or sufficiently acquainted with our affaires; without doubt I have more courage, then strength, and more zeale then knowledge: And this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation I made at the entrance into my worke; that no body might de deceiv'd, and that they might search there rather for something which may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite love towards their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, then which should instruct them with things new and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. I declare from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning that I have not any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies assistance, that I have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved neither Notes nor instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and that I walke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a guide or a Companion; And therefore if I commit any faults, I have onely done what I should, and they must be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb facs="tcp:205168:18"/> as proceeding from a man who sees things afar off, and from without, and stayes at the appearance of publicke af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, without penetrating into their inward parts which are hid from him.</p>
            <p>I could enter presently upon my matter, and take a shorter way then that which I have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed; but I had a designe to prepare their minds by a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant discourse to one more se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and to deferre something after the manner of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. You know <hi>my Lord,</hi> that the most part of them, make <hi>Proems</hi> to their bookes which have no agreement with their Subject, and which are like heads fastened on, which you may put upon all bodies. And this is so true, that <hi>Cicero</hi> writes
<pb facs="tcp:205168:19"/> of himselfe that hee had a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of reserves whence hee drew out when hee had any need for the beginning of his workes. So that by chance ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving prefix'd before his booke of Glory, the same Preface which hee had already put to his third booke of the <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mickes,</hi> hee requested <hi>Atticus</hi> very pleasantly to cut off that first booke, and put another which he sent him in its place. In these Prefaces they did ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily discourse of the affaires and Government of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, they complain'd of the corruption of the Age, they related to the world their imployments in the City, and their exercises in the field; and after that, instead of descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding gently, and as it were by
<pb facs="tcp:205168:19"/> degrees into their matter in hand, you would say that they precipitated themselves, so sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and all at once doe they fall upon it. All the <hi>Exordiums</hi> of <hi>Salust</hi> are of this kinde, and would as well fit <hi>Cicero's</hi> Books, as his: After hee hath declaim'd of vice and vertue, and has thrown himself upon an infinite reasoning, hee goes not out at the doore, where he sees himself shut up, but escapes forth by a breach, and breaking off on a suddaine where they thought hee would have gone on; let us come saith he to the businesse in hand; The <hi>Greekes</hi> are more licentious herein, then he. <hi>Dion Chrysostome</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not ordinarily upon his subject till the end of his dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course; and if we take from his
<pb facs="tcp:205168:20"/> Master <hi>Plato</hi> his long Prefaces, his fabulous narrations, his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Digressions, we shall make him shorter by halfe then he is: Both of them are like lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle women undrest, who having put off their Tyres and their Cheopines, are but a piece of themselves. <hi>Plutarch</hi> doubtlesse is one of the most advised and most judicious of the latter <hi>Greeks,</hi> but yet he is fallen into the vice of his age and of his Countrey; and he who can rid himself of the Treatise which hee hath made of the Familiar spirit of <hi>Socrates,</hi> shall easily be able to get out of a Labyrinth. Christian Authours ought to be more austere, and lesse cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious after strange ornaments, yet they cease not to give some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to custome, and to wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<pb facs="tcp:205168:20"/> it out of their Subject.</p>
            <p>And not to trouble you with a tedious ennumeration: The Dialogue which <hi>Minutius Felix</hi> hath made to justifie our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion against the Calumnies of the <hi>Pagans,</hi> hath a beginning no whit at all serious, and very far from the gravity of his matter. And Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in that letter so much esteemed which hee wrote to <hi>Donatus</hi> being a very severe Censure of the manners of his age by a description purely Poeticall, and by a Discourse as gaudy and florid as if hee would have spoken of Love or rehearsed a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>As for mee who have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken a labour of a long breath, I would not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther imitate the Antients,
<pb facs="tcp:205168:21"/> which to their workes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sten others, neither would I altogether avoid them. I have made a Preface where I have spoken as pleasantly as I could of the pleasures of the <hi>Autumne,</hi> because it was the time of the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my <hi>Prince:</hi> Neither have I forgotten the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where I was, because it is the place of his birth, I have beene very glad to give account upon occasion of the entertainment of my Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and to justifie the leisure of a retired person against those that accuse him of sloth and idlenesse. Besides that by the Conclusion you may see the whole businesse is to my purpose, and the adventure which gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb facs="tcp:205168:21"/> to my designe, and which is Historicall and true, happening to mee at the River side which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe, whereof my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions which are not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps tedious, are sometimes necessary, and may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as Circumstances of the Action which I represent, &amp;c.</p>

I deny not but the victorious and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant Newes, which comes daily to us from the Armie, gives mee some motion of Joy, and that I am very sensibly affected with the noise which your Name makes on
<pb facs="tcp:205168:22"/> all sides. But my satisfaction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be intire to learne from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of another, those things whereof I my selfe should bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. And I conceive so much pleasure to consider you in your Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that there is not any Souldier beyond the Mountaines under your Command, whose good fortune I do not envie.</p>
            <p>I forbeare not therefore, <hi>My Lord,</hi> since I cannot serve you with my body and my actions, to adore you night and day in my thoughts, and to employ so deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a worship the noblest part of my selfe. You are next after the King the Eternall object of my mind; I scarce ever divert it from the course of your Life; and if you have more diligent Courtiers then I, and which render you their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects with more shew and ostenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:205168:23"/> I am certaine you have not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny servant more faithfull, nor whose affection comes more from the heart, or is more lively and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall: But that my words may not seem vain and groundlesse, I send you the proofe of what I say, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you shall know, that a man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded has a great inclination to perswade others, and that discourse grounded upon things, and anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with truth, moves the minds of men with more force, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures more credit and beliefe, then that which busy's it selfe to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit only and declame.</p>
            <p>It is a part <hi>My Lord,</hi> drawne from its body, a piece which I have snatched from the labours I have undertaken: To whose perfection I protest freely, that all the houres of leisure more quiet then mine, and all the powers and faculties of
<pb facs="tcp:205168:23"/> a Soule more elevated then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily, had found enough where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to be imployed.

Besides, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure of a Historie where the Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician beares rule, an Authour is carryed by his matter, and the things being done ready to his hand, which easeth him of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Invention, as the progresse of time gives him his order, hee is scarce bound to any thing else then to contribute words: which some have accounted so small; that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nander</hi> being prest to put forth a piece that hee had promised, It is already, said he, there wants one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the words.

            <p>If in all cases <hi>My Lord,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not obtain a place among knowing and skilfull men, I will not be deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one amongst honest and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Servants; and if my Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie be not worthy to be had in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of, by you, my zeale at least deserves not to be rejected. Certainly I am many times so mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that I doubt not but my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments please you, and it is a pleasant recreation for you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a Philosopher in anger. And though true love bee sufficiently content with the Testimony of the conscience, and I render you many proofes of my most humble service, that I assure my selfe you could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver know, I desire neverthelesse some times for your satisfaction, that you could heare me from the
<pb facs="tcp:205168:27"/> place where you are, and see with what advantage I dispute the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like cause: How I confute the false Newes which are made currant, and how I stop their mouthes that would speake disadvantageously of our affaires: It is certain they cannot be more flourishing, nor the successe of the Kings Army more glorious, nor the rest of the people more assur'd, nor your administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion more judicious. And yet wee meet with some spirits who are vexed at their own good, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indure their happinesse, nor be kept in a good beliefe but by super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall prosperities, who have no more faith assoone as there ceaseth to be a miracle. When the present affaires are in good condition they make evill judgements of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in prosperous events their presages are alwaies tragicall; they
<pb facs="tcp:205168:27"/> sweare they esteeme nothing but strangers and forraigne things: They admire <hi>Spinola,</hi> because he is an <hi>Italian</hi> and not of their Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and they are troubled to praise the King because hee is a <hi>French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and their Master; they will scarce confesse hee hath conquer'd after so many Cities taken, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Factions ruin'd, who are the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Monuments of his Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and it hath been easier for him to merit esteeme over all <hi>Europe,</hi> then to gain their approbation. They would perswade us if they could, that he had rais'd the siege from before <hi>Rochell,</hi> and made a dishonourable peace with the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genotes;</hi> that he hath been beaten by the <hi>English,</hi> and that the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> have made him flee: If they could they would blot out his History, and quench the greatest
<pb facs="tcp:205168:28"/> splendour which ought to enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten posterity. I doubt not but they looke with evill eyes in any Booke upon the Images of things which so greatly offend them: And those that believe Fables &amp; <hi>Romances,</hi> and grow extream passionate for a <hi>Hercules</hi> or an <hi>Achilles,</hi> who it is possible never were; who are transported when they reade the Actions of <hi>Roland,</hi> and <hi>Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nould,</hi> which were acted onely up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the paper, will not rellish Truth because it beares witnesse to the vertue of their <hi>Prince.</hi> They will be content, that against the faith of all Antiquity, <hi>Xenophon</hi> who was a <hi>Grecian,</hi> and no <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian</hi> hath dreamt out a life of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> according to his fancy, and that he makes him dye in his bed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his friends, though the truth is, that he dyed in the warre and

            <p>They allow that <hi>Pliny</hi> should lye in a full Senate, and praise <hi>Trajan</hi> for his Temperance and Chastity, though it be true that he was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to wine, and to another vice so foule, that it cannot honestly bee named; and yet they take it ill that being born the Kings Subject, I speak of him what no body can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and that resolving to present an example to <hi>Princes,</hi> I chuse ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his life, then <hi>Cyrus'es</hi> which is fabulous, or then that of <hi>Trajan</hi> which is not very cleane: Not to speake of <hi>Caesar Borgia's</hi> all black with Crimes and lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: Heaven cannot make these people a Superior to please them; He that was after Gods own heart, would not bee after theirs: They would not find <hi>Solomon</hi> wise e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, nor <hi>Alexander</hi> valiant

<pb facs="tcp:205168:29"/> you with that of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and accuse you of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence of <hi>CHARLES</hi> the eight. I suppose they sinne rather out of infirmitie, then malice; that they are rather passionate through their opinions, then Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sionaries of our Enemies; and that they have more need of the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of Phisick, then of those of the Lawes.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is a vexation to see the Impertinents of this Age hold the same language with the Rebels of the pass'd, and to abuse the benefit of Liberty against him that hath procured it for us. They come every day to tell me that wee shall receive much disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from the discontent of a <hi>Prince</hi> which is separated from us; and I answer them, it is much better to have a weake Enemy to

            <p>They will have the King at any rate to relieve <hi>Cazal,</hi> and I say he hath done it already by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hee hath now put his affaires, at the worst, it will be taken onely to be surrendred againe. They are not content to have you execute extraordinary actions, They would have you doe impossible ones: And though there grow sometimes such difficulties in things which cannot be surmounted by reason of the repugnancy of the Subject, and not for the default of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker, they are not answered with those reasons wherewith wise men rest satisfied, and many times would have the <hi>King</hi> doe that which the great <hi>Turke</hi> and the <hi>Persian</hi> joyn'd together cannot d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>All this, <hi>My Lord,</hi> would cause in mee a great indignation, neither should I bee able to indure that excesse of Ingratitude, but that I know there was a malicious spirit which found fault with the workes of God, and was not afraid to say, that had he bin of his Counsell, as well in the Creation of the world, as in the Government of it, he could have given him better advice then he had taken, and then usually he followed.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have beene long enough in the world, but have lived onely during the last Autumne; and because it is not possible to recall those happy dayes which were so deare to me, I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to retain some rellish of them by remembrance and discourse. The liberty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I found my self after 3. years Captivity, (for so I call my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode in the City) the purity of the ayre which I began to
<pb facs="tcp:205168:32"/> breath, and as eagerly drew in, as if it had beene some new-found nourishment; the smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling face of the field, which yet shewed forth some part of its riches, and drest it selfe with the last presents it would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow on us mortals, all these rendered my thoughts so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull and calme, that not at all stirred with the passion of joy, I remain'd possess'd of its pleasure.</p>
            <p>Those other more importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate maladies of the soule, which torment the Court, and solemne Assemblies, did not at all approach our village; I knew not what it was to hope or feare; nor was I any longer acquainted with suspicion, distrust, or jealousie. All my owne passions were at rest, and
<pb facs="tcp:205168:32"/> those of others reach'd not me. Envie and hatred which are so cruelly fastened to that small shadow of good, which some men seemed to discern among my many faults, assaulting me where I was not, did mee no hurt that I felt; and the present objects did so fill my spirits, and so cleerely deface the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of what had pass'd, that as they left no place for future apprehensions, so there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no disquietnesse to trouble my memory.</p>
            <p>In this condition, farre diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the tumult from whence I departed, and under the serenity of so benigne an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of heaven, I seemed to be really new borne, and to assist at this new production of all things. And truly had wee,
<pb facs="tcp:205168:33"/> during that season, obtain'd the Government of the world, and bin our selves permitted to make the dayes; we could not have had fairer; nor have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spensed shade and light, cold and heate with a more equall measure.</p>
            <p>There arose a small thin mist from the neighbouring River which wrapp'd up as it were in a bottome, thence dispers'd it selfe over the surface of the earth. But for asmuch as it tarryed not for the Sun to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell it, neither could abide its first rayes, it never had so much strength as to ascend as high as our lowest windowes; and we injoy'd a most faire calme and lively brightnesse, whil'st there was some trouble and smoake below us. Before wee
<pb facs="tcp:205168:33"/> were drest and had said our prayers, that moysture which had bedewed onely the tops of the grasse, was wholly wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped off, and the freshnesse of the morning was no longer moist or sharpe, so that there was left a convenient time to take a walke till noone, and to do those exercises, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>create the body without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it, and which moderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly awaken the appetite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out carrying it to a disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly hunger, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly followes violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and retaines something of a disease.</p>
            <p>The former part of the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone, was pass'd over in fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar discourse; from whence we banish'd all affaires of State, controversies of Religion, and
<pb facs="tcp:205168:34"/> questions of Philosophy. There none eagerly disputed whether the Pope was above a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell; no body troubled himself to unite the <hi>Princes</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stendome; to make a league a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Turke;</hi> It was not violently debated, who was the greatest Captaine, <hi>Marquesse Spinola,</hi> or <hi>Count Tilly:</hi> No bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reformed Kingdomes, nor would change their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; It was not permitted so much as to name the publicke, nor the age; we talk'd of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the goodnesse of our Melons, the reaping of our corne, the hope of our vintage. Our discourse once ended, the Company parted, and of foure which wee were, one went to the Groves, another to the Garden, a third to a Gallery
<pb facs="tcp:205168:34"/> where there were Cards and Tables; for me, I retir'd to my Chamber, and tryed to slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber over a booke, as little seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous as our former discourse had bin: But the day beginning to decline, and the remainder of the heate being now no more troublesome to be indured then the steam of a luke-warm Bath, I usually went a horseback, and rode from my lodging thorow a long alley of white mulber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, which led mee to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; then whose Chrystall streames nothing could be seen more cleare and pleasant; and <hi>Ronsard</hi> doth great wrong to derive it from <hi>Acheron,</hi> and to conceive that it is an arme of that dismall Lake, whose wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are represented to us so black and muddy: It is rather
<pb facs="tcp:205168:35"/> a continued fountaine from its first rise till it empties it self into the Sea; where, after it hath run 30. Leagues, it entereth so fresh and pure, as if but then it issued from the Spring head: It generally manures all that it watereth, and if the same Countrey be extreamly barren and extreamly fertile, they are the effects of its remotenesse &amp; of its presence. At that part of it where I did chiefly rest my self, it runs beneath certain lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le hills, which are green from the top to the bottome with a brushie wood which they bear; and the descent being very steep, you would say the trees are not planted there but tyed, or that they creep there, and not grow, they seem to have such slender hold. In some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb facs="tcp:205168:35"/> the river is broad enough in others the channell so thrusts it selfe together, that the Pop lars which grow on each sid seem to kisse, and joyning thei boughes toge her, embrace one another with so handsome an evennesse, that an Arbour can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee better made if art and the workmans violence had twisted them.</p>
            <p>There, not being able to do what <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Laelius</hi> did at the Sea-side, where they onely counted the waves and gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Cockles; I had the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to behold in the bottome of the water those things which passed in the ayre, and to see that swim, which looking up I saw fly above.</p>
            <p>This med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tation entertained me whilest I expected the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb facs="tcp:205168:36"/> of the Sun, at what time I never failed to be in the middle of the meddow that I might consider at my ease that rich effussion of Colours which it sheds abroad at its withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and wherein the beames seem to be temper'd and allayd, thereby to render themselves supportable, sweetly mollify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its luster, if by that meanes it may favour the sight of the earnest beholder.</p>
            <p>But having but a very short time to injoy the contentment I received every evening in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring this faire spectacle, and viewing those precious tracks it leaveth behind in the heaven, at its farewell, together with that diversity of Colours, which are produced at the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of its rayes; there was
<pb facs="tcp:205168:36"/> no way to make me returne to my lodging, but that night came on, and drawing a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain over this glory, put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to the magnificence of the sight which detained me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. And because so happy a season could not be long, I was willing to enjoy every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant; and I had so well mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the smallest parts of its stay, that I chose rather to take the coolenesse of the Even, then to lose the rest of the day. And as we double our embraces to persons whom wee love, when we are presently to part; and as old men more earnestly desire that life which they are now bidding adieu to: so had I the most violent passions for a Good which began to desert me, and which the neer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
<pb facs="tcp:205168:37"/> of the winter threatned every houre to ravish from me. When I saw it begin to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, I was not seen any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to follow my former kinde of life, nor to do as I did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore many pieces of the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone. I was sociable but till noone, presently after I went abroad all alone, and had no patience till I came to my deare river; along which as I walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one day after my usuall cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome, (and it was, if I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, the very same day that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> on a suddain beyond the river I know not what yellow and blue, which appeared among the poplars, and made th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> weeds to shake. <hi>Virgils Aeneid</hi> which by chance I had in my
<pb facs="tcp:205168:37"/> hands, and where I was reading the Apparition of <hi>Tyber</hi> to <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas,</hi> which happened much after this manner, had so filled my spirits with the follies of Poetry, that I began to imagine that the fantasme which I dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered might be the God of our river: But I quickly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected the extravagancy of my fancy, and saw distinctly a slaxen hair'd man which held toward me a blue plush bonnet: Whereat knowing that hee stood in need of my charity, &amp; the channell being not narrow enough in that place to throw him that almes I would give him, I beckoned to a Fisher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was spreading his nets some twenty paces from me, to go fetch him over in his boate. He was a Gentleman of
<pb facs="tcp:205168:38"/>
               <hi>Flanders</hi> who came from <hi>Spain,</hi> and though very poore and ill clad, did notwithstanding give proofe he was well borne, and of good education, though at present he were in very bad equipage. He told me that comming from <hi>Loretto,</hi> he was taken by a <hi>Turkish</hi> vessell, and carried to <hi>Algiers</hi> with some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Christians; who, to save the charges which they should have made by land, hired a Barque at <hi>Ancona,</hi> which was to carry them to <hi>Marseilly.</hi> He told me a long story of his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; the bad entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he received from diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Masters, which had bought him one from another, and the insupportable humour of the Last, who, having neither rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son nor humanity, doubled all
<pb facs="tcp:205168:38"/> the imployments of his service, and at last put him in such a condition, that being altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unprofitable, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained to leave him, for a Pisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, to a Religious man of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy.</hi> He did not forget to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe to me those two terrible Prisons which are under the City of <hi>Algier,</hi> and which may very well be called the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the living; for there they interr every night twelve thousand Slaves, and let them out in the morning, to send them to their ordinary Labour. And certainely he did so please himselfe with this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and was so overwhelmed therewith sometimes, that I perceived very well, that his passed paines were his present contentments; and that the
<pb facs="tcp:205168:39"/> good which we hope for doth not more flatter our imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then the evill which wee have suffered contenteth our memory. I gave him then to oblige him, the most quiet and favorable hearing that he could desire from so curious an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditor: I interessed my selfe in his disgraces by the frequent exclamations wherewith I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied that which he said, and suffered him to say the same thing over and over with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interrupting him, that I might not seem to deprive him of that liberty, which he onely came to recover.</p>
            <p>Thus having long heard him with content, I as'kd him ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny questions for my particular satisfaction, and perhaps wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him to answer so many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrogatories.
<pb facs="tcp:205168:39"/> I desir'd to know what pollicy the <hi>Moores</hi> use, what customes they observe, and to what exercises they are addicted. Amongst other things he told mee, that every <hi>Friday</hi> they made publick prayers to God, to restore to them the Kingdome of <hi>Granada,</hi> and curs'd the memory of the last King, who could not defend it against <hi>Ferdinand.</hi> He informed me of many such particulars, which History never taught me, and though it were impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to retain him longer then two dayes, whatever intreaty I made him, I received at my ease during that time all the profit he had drawn from a sad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, and the multitude of his misfortunes.</p>
            <p>But truly that which pleased
<pb facs="tcp:205168:40"/> me most in his discourse, and left me fully satisfied for the chance of meeting with him, was that after I had ask'd him if the <hi>Moores</hi> had as much curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity as I, or if like other barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people, they lived in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ignorance of forraigne affaires; he made me answer, that there was no other dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course at this day in <hi>Affrica,</hi> but of the victories of our <hi>King,</hi> and that <hi>Rochel</hi> had been the Cause, that yeare, of a thousand wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, and almost of as many quarrels; so far, that among the Slaves, a <hi>Frenchman</hi> being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed against a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who maintain'd it would never be taken, and that the <hi>King</hi> could never compasse his end without the assistance of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spaine,</hi> the <hi>Frenchman</hi> not able
<pb facs="tcp:205168:40"/> to indure that word, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving nothing to repulse it, made his chaines serve for weapons, wherewith he strook his fellow so violently, that he stretch'd him starke dead at the feet of their Common Master.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Ertainely that action seemed to me so extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, that if he that told me had not assured me of the truth thereof by most great and religious oathes, I must needs protest there was too much gallantry in it to be true. But I had no reason to suspect the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie he gave me, partly, for that it proceeded from the mouth of a Gentleman originally a <hi>Spaniard</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and consequently a Subject to the same <hi>Prince</hi> with him that was slain, as also for other suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient considerations. I was ravished with content to see in the extreame
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:205168:42"/> old age of the world, and in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay of all things, <hi>France</hi> should yet bring forth Children worthy the first vigour of their Mother. One so generous an example produced in me at the same time Love and Jealousie, I was extremely moved, and said within my self; Since poor Captives, who can hardly breath under the weight of their Irons, love a <hi>Prince</hi> so dearly, who hath not delivered them from slavery; and to say truly, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neither hands nor strength, do kill the enemies of his Crown by their bare courage: Since the Slaves of <hi>Algier</hi> become the Souldiers of <hi>Lewis the Just,</hi> and those that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not at all in his prosperity, share neverthelesse in his glory; What pretence is there, that living in a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, whereof he is more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the Freer then of the rest of <hi>France;</hi> and the principall fruit of his travels belonging to my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that I should behold with an indifferent mind so many good deeds
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:205168:42"/> which he hath done, and secretly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, without speaking a word, a lazie and stupid felicitie? What shew of reason is there, that living in the field of victory, and seeing nothing round about me but people ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed, and Enemies vanquished, that the presence of so glorious an object cannot stirre up my idle dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and furnish me with one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous thought? What colour is there, that I am not awakened at this great noise, which rising here, makes it self to be heard to the utmost parts of the earth, and that I receive no impression of a light so neer and full of luster; which spreading it selfe already over the Sea, shines forth even to the very Dens and Caves of the Barbarians.</p>
               <p>We must be more lively touched with the good fortune of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth, and take more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our proper happinesse; we must produce some act of our joy, if there be now no more time to give
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:205168:43"/> proofes of our courage, and give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie that wee love the State, though we have not bin in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to serve it. We must no longer rest in the slumber and silence of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; Neither ought I to be the onely mute among the acclamations of the people, nor the onely unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Artisan in the preparations for this triumph.</p>
               <p>Yet now that I consider these things more calmely, and that I am return'd out of that extasie where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I was transported, I am afraid that the poverty of the place where I am, will not furnish mee with any thing wherewith I may worthily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough take pains in so noble and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an employment: We have no quarreys of Marble, nor mines of gold, whence I may take out those ornaments which I desire.</p>
               <p>The wealth of <hi>Paris</hi> is not found in our village; our Land sufficeth for necessity, but affords us no delicates. In vain also do I seek for the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:205168:43"/> of another, and look after the helps of conference, beholding no objects but those that speake not at all; and passing my life among dead things and inanimate. What can trees and rocks teach me? what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement is there between Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry and the Politickes? whom can I consult where I find no body? Since the Court is so farre distant, Newes growes old before it comes to our hands? Am not I one of the last to whom the renown is brought? or do I know any thing till it is publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and in print. I have gained the knowledge of many things in the world no otherwayes. No body hath furnished me with Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and instructions to supply the want of that knowledge which I have not. I walke without a guide and without company. All the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which another might have I am destitute of, and I protest, I am very ill provided of necessary abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities to undergoe the dignity of that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:205168:44"/> designe I now take in hand. Yet I feele my self, as it were, compelled to venture abroad in this occasion. It is not possible for me to resist that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motion which driveth me for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>
               <p>I cannot hinder my selfe from speaking of the <hi>King</hi> and of his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue: to cry aloud to all Princes, that this is the example which they ought to follow; to aske all people and all ages of the world, if they have ever seen any such like thing. A <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite</hi> is about to speak his advice of the most magnificent and stateliest thing in an active life. I will throw my selfe with my single common sense into the greatest affaires of Christendome: I will crosse the Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in a wicker-boate. Wherefore I doubt not what extreame hazard I run, and how much I am in danger to be ship-wrack'd in the very Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. My rashnesse cannot prove suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessefull but by a miracle; I can only make my selfe remarkeable by my
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:205168:44"/> errours: It will easily be seen by the mistakes in my writings, that I am a stranger to the world, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biter of a desart.</p>
               <p>Yet forasmuch as herein I exercise no civill nor military charge; I give no arrests nor leade men to warre, and a private man may faile and his errours not be dangerous, I comfort my selfe, that mine shall no wayes injure my Countrey, and that my grossest ignorance shall not cost her the life of the most unprofitable Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen. I utterly renounce whatever I have pretended to in the art of speaking well, to acquit me of an action of pietie: my reputation is not so deare to me as my duty; and I had rather you should blame my zeale then my roughnesse, my vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence then my lazie slacknesse: I aime not at glory, I only satisfie my conscience. And if it be true, that no body is more sensible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of rest, then he that can taste it by the rules of Philosophie,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:205168:45"/> which teacheth one his dutie well enough, though it give nothing wherewith to be discharged of it; I should commit a fault if making pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of so noble a study, I did not rise from the effects to the Cause, and did not give in some proofe of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement toward the second founder of this State; By whose be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit I live here in safety upon the borders of <hi>Charante:</hi> I consider at my ease the diverse beauties of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and possesse without trouble all the riches of the Countrey.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:205168:46"/> strength of his resolution, hath sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted the violence of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and of the Starres: We may further adde this truth, that he hath made all the world wise, and hath got other Subjects, and another peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and that the conditions to which he hath reduced the factious, are such, that the worst they can do, is to wish ill, and to desire that the times may change.</p>
               <p>The Peace which he hath procured us, is certainly a more substantiall and durable good then all those we have seen. It is neither the necessitie of affaires, nor the wearisomnesse of the warre, nor the consideration of his divers events which hath obliged him to bestow it upon us; It hath flowed freely from his owne good disposition, after an intire and full victorie; after the last roote of evill was cut, and that things were put out of the power of Fortune. It is built upon the destruction of whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could trouble it, and our rest is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:205168:47"/> so firmely and securely established that if the Admirall of — and the Marshall of — should return into the world, with all their subtleties, and cunning plots, they would not be able to give us one false alarme. We need not feare then that those great Spirits, who have kept the age in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall unquietnesse, who have raised stormes in the serenity of the most halcyon dayes, and who now would remain idle knowing not how to doe us hurt, have left Schollers more cunning then themselves, and more ingenuous, for the ruine of their Countrey.</p>
               <p>We need not feare (as hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) that the discontents of some particular men should beget publick miseries, nor that the first motion of their anger should be followed with the taking of Townes, and the desolation of the Countrey. All their ill humours will spend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for the future in their closet, and against their domestick servants:
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:205168:47"/> They will grow angry at lesse char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges then they did, when there were not offices and governments enough to appease them. The State will be no more troublesome to be governed, then a well ordered house: All will obey from the children to the hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and that multitude of <hi>Kings</hi> who have so long shared <hi>France,</hi> will at last be brought to the common right, and render to one that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty which was divided among many.</p>
               <p>Who is there thinke you, that would adde his own misfortunes to those of another, and follow the example of those men who have lost themselves, or who appear yet wet, and come forth dropping from the wrack? who can so much as dreame of new stirres and tumults if he but call to mind what he hath seen, which he may hope to do if he have not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together lost his memory? what rashnesse shall he be guiltie of who shall place himself before that impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous

Let him but command any one to come and render him account of his actions, he will not deliberate whether he ought to go or no, though he may very well feare the successe of his journey; he will bring his head, and not send a Declaration. Let him when ever he pleaseth release Prisoners; they are not lesse in his power for being at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, he will not disseise himself of their persons, he will onely enlarge the circuite of their prison; He will only hold them by a longer chaine then formerly he did, and permitting them to live with the rest of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, he will only increase the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their keepers; so that tortures and punishments will bee no more needfull in his Kingdome; Men will not make use any more of those harsh remedies which the weaknesse and impotency of some have put in execution, and which cannot preserve the whole without the losse of some

There is no need that our Heretickes make any more account of Heads of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of Townes, nor of Assemblies, they will have nothing left them but their heresie, which being stript na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and despoil'd of these humane advantages which covered its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deformity will every day loose its old Patriots, and get no new ones.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:205168:51"/> The firmest servant that he hath is not made triall of under a thousand crownes pension: Hee hath not one man under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which yields him true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to whom he must not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise one thing to obtain another: They all generally thinke to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to him by the society of the same fault, and that every one hath an equall share in that power which belongeth lawfully to no body: So that to preserve this vain Image of a fancyed command, hee must go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne them with dishonest arts, and at first must allow of licence even against his own person.</p>
               <p>He must be the Flatterer and corrupter of his own Army, and must every day invent newes to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain their hopes; He must com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Prophesies to amuse the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and assure them that the <hi>Casi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirs</hi> shall passe the <hi>Loyre,</hi> and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne <hi>France</hi> once more with their <hi>Lansquenets</hi> and <hi>Reisters.</hi> And
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:205168:51"/> after this he must counterfeit let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from <hi>Bethlem Gabor,</hi> signifying that the <hi>Turke</hi> is making hast to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, because <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> have failed; and in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry apprehension of his approaching ruine, and amidst all the horrors of desperation, hee must have all the countenances and appearances of a contented man. In the meane time I am confident for these two yeares he hath received no other joyes but those which miserable men feele be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene their sentence and execution. The bad dayes that he spends are not followed with better nights; and if he would take any rest, in the meane time his imagination which wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, represents to him a mutiny in the Campe, or a sedition in the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which seiseth him to make their peace more advantageous, or one of his own who holds a ponyard at his brest, or the angry incensed counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his <hi>Master,</hi> who reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him with his Felony, and at last
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:205168:52"/> abandons him to the ordinary course of Justice. Certainly if one could see the torments and Agitations of his poore soule, I doubt not but it would move him to compassion.</p>
               <p>Wee have not one Voluntiere in all our Troopes who would change conditions with this unfortunate Generall; and who understands not in this sense the words which <hi>Homer</hi> speakes to his <hi>Achilles,</hi> That those who obey in this world are better then those that command in hell.</p>
               <p>It is no hard matter then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if he were to beginne againe but he would preferre a voluntary banishment before the condition of being head of a party, and that now looking at the future, which presents nothing but what is sad and Tragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, he already envieth the priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of <hi>Bois de Vincennes</hi> which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect at least in rest the mercy of the King. He looketh on all sides how he may get out of this confusion of various misfortunes, and seeketh for
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:205168:52"/> a passage to returne to his duty: But there are no degrees in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice; We never see them go up againe who have throwne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves downe thence, and there is no lesse danger for a man to be dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged of Tyranny, then there was to beginne it. <hi>Phalaris</hi> was ready to desert it, but he demanded a God for Caution, who should bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsable for his life, if he dispoiled himselfe of his authority. And it hath ever been a common opinion that those that have taken up armes against their Country or their Prince, are in some sort reduced to a necessity to do ill, by reason of the little security they can find in doing well: They dare not become inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent for feare of putting themselves to the mercy of the Lawes which they have offended, and do continue their faults, because they conceive no body is satisfied with their repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Yet the goodnesse of the King may assure the spirits whom
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:205168:53"/> these <hi>Maximes</hi> would have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted; It is not subject to the rules of vulgar pollicy, and is in a condition to sweeten, and change them at his pleasure.</p>
               <p>The rigour and courtesie which is used in the uncertainty of events, and in the violence of doing ill, are the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects rather of necessity then of vertue. There are, to speake truely, honest and specious feares which give testimony that we would not have powerfull enemies, when wee do the worst we can to ours; and when we deale gently with them, that we expect also like entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: But the continuall prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the King, leaves no place for such thoughts, it taketh away all suspicion of hypocrisie from his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and leaveth it to his choice to use justice or mercy as seemeth him best. He onely can recover <hi>M. de</hi>— from the extremity he is fallen into, and affoord him a meanes, how hee may purchase a glorious death in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:205168:53"/> some forraine occasion, which look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at his service, or to passe a quiet old age in the feasts and tryumphs of the Court. His hands are not shortned since his last deeds of Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie. And if they extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves towards one that sinneth with remorse; who hath not forgotten his name nor his birth, and who certainly deserves to be preserv'd; Men will praise him every where, for that after he hath suppres'd the pride of the Rebels, he doth not quarrell with the misfortune of the afflicted.</p>
               <p>I dare not say that the Authors of the revolt who have denied their <hi>Prince,</hi> and would sell their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey to a stranger, ought to receive so favourable an entertainment, or that there should faile to be some example to appease the soules of the dead, and to give satisfaction to the publike.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> neverthelesse can doe herein that which no body can aske
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:205168:54"/> him a reason of; and the sweetnesse of his disposition hath oftentimes corrected the severity of the office he dischargeth: But when he would be liberall of his injuries, in pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those who have so sensibly offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, what should they do with that Grace, which they cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly injoy, in the midst of a provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Nation? What use could they make of liberty if it were more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to them then a prison? Or what good were it to escape the Justice of the <hi>Parliament</hi> to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to the vengeance of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? They are so odious in the whole Kingdome, that they can onely goe abroad in the night. The most tenderest natures are not touched with their disgraces, and though it be the nature of misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to move compassion in those that behold it, they are hated as if they were not at all miserable.</p>
               <p>It comes into mens minds that they have alwaies kindled those
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:205168:54"/> combustions which we have seen; that they have been the first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd, and the first breakers of the publike faith, that they rays'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions when trouble it selfe was at rest, and have advanced the insur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of their party by the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiency of their own Rebellion; It will be remembred, how in a full peace they they were the Pirats of our Seas, and the violators of the freedome of our Havens; That they oppos'd themselves to the greatnesse of <hi>France;</hi> That they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied the glory of the <hi>King,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted his inclination from a noble enterprise out of this Kingdome, by domesticke hinderances which they rais'd within. We know that they have divided Kings, and broken the Alliances of the Crown; That their seditious speeches have spread the fire, and blown it on all sides; That they endeavoured to stirre up all <hi>Europe</hi> against their Country; That they have been at the end of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:205168:55"/> the world to seek enemies for us; and have made so small account of the name of <hi>France,</hi> that they were not ashamed to waite the rising of a <hi>Favorite</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and to bow the knee before a forraine power. The Rebels abroad do look upon them as the evill Angels which tempted them, and inspired them with the first fury of Arms, which have succeeded so unluckily.</p>
               <p>It is very true that they pressed the succours which came to them, and have made use of our Neighbours with affection and care; But they have not been so good Conductors of their Troops, as good Soliciters of their affaires; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had prepared the War and engaged Souldiers, they have for the most part alwaies contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to give bold counsells, and to deliberate couragiously; Thus they have thrust those upon dangers whom they should have led thither; who reproach them continually
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:205168:55"/> with their wounds and their losses, and believe they commit a crime to live after the ruine of their Party.</p>
               <p>They are in no better esteeme among strangers, and if it were pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to gather the voices of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple together, they would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Common Jury of mankind, and driven from all the Sanctuaries of the earth.</p>

               <p>NOw without doubt, as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the extreame hatred which is born them comes from the extreame love men have to the <hi>King.</hi> The injuries which are done to a just <hi>Prince</hi> excite universall resentments, and appertaine to the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.

Wee see the inhabitants of sacked Cities, reverencing the vertue of their destroyers; who blesse the thunder that smote them, and acknowledge that the warre which was made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, was neither any head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long motion of anger, nor any effect of an evill will towards them; but a necessary conclusion of all the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of wisedome, and the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy which could put them in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition: They confesse they injoy in the losse of <hi>Rochel</hi> that secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which they could not find in her prodigious fortifications, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain no more of their fall since they lye in the bosome of their Father.

Behold under the Lawes and in his Duty, him, who seeth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Heaven above him, who can sinne against none but God one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Who weares a Crown as Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent as any in the world can be; and f r whom, the Church, which spends her thunders upon all others heads, hath nothing but blessings and graces: He, I say, payes so perfect an obedience to reason; and mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth his actions with so exact an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestie, that I seem, in stead of the King of <hi>France,</hi> to see the King of <hi>Lacedemon,</hi> who had no other ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage above his Subjects, but that

But when al the powers of hell rise up at once to assault him; when his eies, his eares, and all the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of his heart are beseiged, and that the enemy seeks to enter at every gate, he doth certainly, as it were, more then he ought, if he withstand such violent onsets, and resist so many assailants.</p>
               <p>When pleasant objects presse him and pursue him on all sides, and the end of the fairest things is to render themselves worthy of his love. When the sparkling of Diamonds kindles in his soule a desire to have them, and the bignesse of the Jewel

He already beholds the earth as those that look down upon it from Heaven; Nothing appeare great to him in so small a space: He finds nothing worthy whereon to rest his thoughts, or to take up his desires: All that it containes will

               <p>LEt no man talk to me of that dull imitation of Piety which only looks for Spectators; which amuseth the world with countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and busieth it self rather to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the motions of the head, and to appear in certain postures of the face, then to regulate the affections of the soule: This is a meer action of the body, and of very easie performance; the greatest dissability is corrected at the first tryall; There needeth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther strength nor industry, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no more pains then those easie sports which recreate without wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying, and are learnt without a Master.</p>
               <p>It is a kind of lazinesse disguised under an honester name then its own; or at most, but a faint and idle imployment, which a man may very
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:205168:66"/> worthily discharge, when he can do nothing, and which is wholly taken up either in mumbling some confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed words, or in a meer moving of the lips, or lastly in a soft glance of the eyes after a counterfeited sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>There is another kind of false Devotion more dangerous then this; I mean that fearfull trembling devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which imagines that God is busied in his Blessed rest, only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare pain and punishments for him; and that he afflicts Kingdomes and sends pestilence and famines, only for the hatred he bears them. Visions go forth as in a throng of his troubled imagination, which afterward come before him as so many strange and unknown Monsters.</p>
               <p>There passeth no night but the Ghosts of dead men appear unto him, with strange shapes and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full attendance, which his fancy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowes upon them. He never heares a cry in the night but he believes it to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:205168:67"/> be the complaint of a departed soule; If he see one part of the ayre blacker and more thick then another, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently conceives it a phantasme.

               <p>This so weakens the spirit and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates the courage, that those that are smitten with it, dare not injoy themselves in time of peace, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend themselves in the necessity of warre. One foolish dream is enough to make them desist from a good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe; of five dayes they reckon foure unluckie, and make choise of those houres and moments, which they have marked with white, before they undertake any the least businesse; so that oftentimes the opportunity slips over before they have fix'd their resolution.

               <p>These men adore all their suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and their doubts; They make Saints by their own private authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without tarrying till they are dead, or for the Oracle of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Bishop.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:205168:68"/> pardon their companions.</p>
               <p>After this the grossest and the fullest bodies appear to them trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent and full of light; There's not a haire of the head which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, but seemes to them a ray of its Crown; They think that to be a Saint in an extasie, which is but a woman in a swoone: They swear that they have revelations of things to come, and yet they scarce know the ordinary news of the time when one hath told them. In their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is as easie to raise a dead man, as to awaken one asleep.</p>
               <p>If you will believe them, the world is continually troubled with prodigies, and they can more easily perswade themselves, that something happens contrary to the ordinary course of nature, then that he that relates it should be a lyar.

The judgement which is made of the goodnesse of things by their meer outside and externall appearance, is not alwaies infallible: Sometimes a lye is more likely then Truth, and wickednesse makes a fairer shew then goodnesse it self. No man doubts but that it is a work of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to redeem prisoners, to pay the

               <p>How many false Philosophers have there been, who under an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stere visage have concealed most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate affections; who have despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed glory out of pride not humility; who have professed poverty to make <hi>Princes</hi> reverence them. In the scrip of that famous <hi>Cynick</hi> who lived in the dayes of <hi>Lucian,</hi> where one would have thought there was nothing but beanes and course bread, were found a bale of Dice, a box of Perfumes, and the portraiture of a woman. He that you think is fled into the wildernesse to be at leasure to contemplate, with lesse distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance, is gone thither, perhaps, to make false money with more securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:205168:70"/>
               <p>We have heard of a <hi>Prince</hi> who retired himself very orderly every Holy-day into religious houses, and there, while people thought that he examined his conscience and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med other spirituall exercises, he was taken many times making dispatches, and entertaining secret audiences. Do not trust a feigned humility, not the evill deportment of that dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of consciences, who alwaies seems prepared to die; for within he is cloathed with purple; he hath the ambition of four <hi>Kings;</hi> he hath designes for another age. But above all, defie those workers of iniquity, powerfull in malice, who lift up pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted hands to Heaven, and are not afraid to approach our our most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred mysteries being yet bloody with their parricides.</p>
               <p>They are cruell, Incestuous, Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious, and yet cease not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout: Their devotion corrects their gestures, reformes their haire, but doth not at all touch their passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:205168:70"/> nor meddle with thir vices. They make it all their vertue to praise <hi>Catholikes</hi> and speak evill of <hi>Hugenotes:</hi> Oh what great exploits would they do in a massacre, and how valiant would they be against men asleep, and invited to a mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
               <p>Their zeale, which according to the meaning of the Holy Ghost, ought to devoure themselves, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth their Neighbour, and burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Towns and Provinces; They gain nothing by frequenting holy things, but the contempt which grows from familiaritie, &amp; the custome to violate them. They became more bold to commit wickednesse, and not at all more honest, they lose the scruple, and leave not the sin; so that we may believe they come not so much to Church to ask pardon for their faults, as leave to commit more, and to sin with authoritie.</p>
               <p>And as some of the <hi>Primitive Christians</hi> made nothing of it to
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:205168:71"/> drink overmuch, sitting upon the Tombs of the <hi>Martyrs;</hi> they fancy also, that all wickednesse is permitted them, provided they retain some shew of Pietie,</p>
               <p>The most part of great men have alwaies had this specious devotion; and though it be a usuall vizard, and known to every one, yet they cease not to make use of it, thereby to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buse the people.</p>
               <p>Do we not know those that mingle God among their passions, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage him in their Interests, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him upon all occasions? If they usurpe a Kingdom, over which they have no right but that of convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie or force, they say it is to hinder the Enemies of the Church from seising upon it, and to prevent an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill, which possibly would never fall out.</p>
               <p>If their Avarice makes them crosse the Seas, and run to the worlds end, they publish, it is for the good of souls, and the desire they have to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:205168:71"/> save Infidels, that drawes them thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and yet it is very true, that the charitie of these good Christians, carries them only to those Countries where the Sun warms the earth into gold; and is not at all employed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the furthest part of the North, where are soules enough to be converted, but where they can only get frost and Snow. They are sollicitous only for the salvation of the people of <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexica,</hi> and being arrived thither, they speak so little to them of our faith, and sell a confus'd and imperfect picture at so dear a rate, that it is easie to see, the pretence which they make is not the cause of their voyage; At their first landing, they lade their vessels with all sort of riches which the Countrey affords, and spend whole ages to seek more which are hid in Mines, insomuch, that there scarce comes one <hi>Pistole</hi> into <hi>Europe,</hi> which doth not cost the life of an <hi>Indian,</hi> and is not the sinne of a <hi>Catholique.</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:205168:72"/> In the mean time, they suffer antient Divinitie to cry in the Schooles and Pulpits, where she is listened to only by women and children. She saith sufficiently, that the least evill is forbidden, though it produce ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so great a good. That if the world cannot be preserved without a sin, let it perish: That it is not for us to trouble the course of <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,</hi> and to interesse our selves in things above: That God hath put in our hands his Commandements, and not the guidance of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse; and bids us do our Duty, and let God alone with his own work.</p>
               <p>There is sprung up since, another Divinity more sweet and pleasant, which can better fit it self to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of great ones, which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modates all these <hi>Maximes</hi> to their Intentions, and is not rude and uncivill as that former.</p>
               <p>The Court hath brought forth some Doctors, who have found
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:205168:72"/> out the means, to make vice agree with vertue, and to unite extreams so farre opposite. They allow expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diences for those who have taken other folks goods, for a power to keep them with a safe conscience. They teach <hi>Princes</hi> to enterprise up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the life of other <hi>Princes,</hi> after they have declared them Hereticks in their Closet. They teach them to shorten warrs, which they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend long and chargeable, by Assas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinats, where they hazard only the person of a Traytor, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge themselves of their children without any legall proceeding, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be with the consent of their Confessour.</p>
               <p>Besides, as if our Lord were merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie, and would be corrupted with gifts: as if he were the <hi>Pagans Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter,</hi> whom they call to share in their spoiles and Booties; after a number of infinite crimes whereof they are guiltie, they require of them neither tears, restitution, nor
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:205168:73"/> pennance; It is enough that they bestow some small almes upon the Church. They compound with them for that which they have taken from a thousand persons, for a small part which they give to others to whom they owe nothing: And they are made believe, that the Foundation of a Convent, or the guilding of a Chappel, dispenseth with them for all obligations of Christianitie, and all vertues of Moralitie.</p>

But what need is there of a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing Divinitie, when it doth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what the severest injoyns him to? To what use are the sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of paint and plaisters, since he hath no spot to cover, nor deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to disguise? Or what pleasure can he take in the wrangling of three or foure <hi>Sophisters</hi> among the applaudings of the people, and the praises of renown?</p>
               <p>Knowing that our Religion commands us to abstain from all appearance of evill, and to do that which is good, not only before God, but also before men; he contents not himself with a secret pietie, and bare worship of the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, but believeth, that he is bound
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:205168:74"/> to give something to the eyes of the world, and hath a care by his exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to edifie his people.</p>
               <p>The least Ceremonies which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect divine worship, he esteems highly of: he mingles his voice, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, with the publick prayers, and is mindfull of the Speech of a <hi>King,</hi> like himself: <hi>I am weary of cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I am hoarse, mine eyes faile for crying, and looking after my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet this devotion hath alwayes more substance then shew, and is like those Trees whose roots are longer then their branches: It is not bodily, nor tyed to sensible ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: It hath its seat in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which is perfectly enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, which hath no mean belief concerning the things of heaven; nor hath any, but most found and reasonable opinions of this first and excellent cause, of which most men make such rash and precipitated judgments.</p>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:205168:74"/>
               <p>But because this quality would be, as it were, dead, and of no use, if it came not from the highest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the soule, where the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course and the understanding are formed, and seeing it must equally reside in the second part, where the affections and the desires receive their birth; he maketh it descend from the head to the heart, that that which was light, may become fire, and that so high and elevated a knowledge, which ought to be fertile in great operations, and issu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth by admirable effects, may not be terminated in it self, nor rest in the idle desires of a bare specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Let us not therefore consider it only at the Altar, and in the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, where without any danger it treateth with God, and exerciseth a peaceable intercourse, which no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can disturb: for it is found in the occasions of warr as well as
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:205168:75"/> there. It appears in the head of our Troops, it goes into the Trenches; and exposeth to all the injuries of the time, to all the ambushments of fortune, the most precious life which is this day in the world. It is not employed only to the structure and garnishing of some stones, but it fasteneth the Altars, and assures the foundations of the Church: It provideth <hi>English</hi> cloth, which he fils with store of Converts, who, to become good, had need to have the power of doing ill taken from them.</p>
               <p>These are the effects of his devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is active, and taketh pains without rest, and thereby prevailes with the <hi>Lord of Hosts,</hi> for victories full of wonders, as well upon the earth, as upon the Sea. And it is so, as I conceive, that God will be praid unto in the time of warr. Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuseth nothing in these occasions to earnest and stirring men, and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much more willingly, the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:205168:75"/> then the lazie; and those who set themselves forward for his graces, and are prepared to receive them, then those who expect them at their lodging, without putting themselves in any condition to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve them.</p>
               <p>That Regiment of Christians, who in the time of <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> and under his Banners, caused thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to fall from heaven upon their enemies from, whence they merited the name of the <hi>Thundering Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> did not obtaine so marvellous a successe with their arms a Crosse, but in the pursuit of a fierce and bold assault, and fighting on all sides.</p>
               <p>And when the winds and the hayle armed themselves at the prayer of the Emperour <hi>Theodosius,</hi> against the Tyrant <hi>Eugenes,</hi> it was a prayer which he made on horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, after he had perform'd the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a good Captain, and render'd himself worthy so great a miracle:
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:205168:76"/> For otherwise to desire of God to favour the unworthy, and that he should bestow upon the cowardly and fearfull, the recompence which is due to labour and valour, would be to make use of him indiscreetly, and to sollicite him to injustice.</p>
               <p>It is necessary therefore, that a <hi>Prince</hi> be devout in this first kind, and as the <hi>King</hi> was at the fight of <hi>Ree,</hi> in the defeat of the <hi>English.</hi> He could not produce a more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent act of Pietie; and if it be infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to that of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> which I can hardly confesse, it is only in one degree, because in the humility of Christianity, suffering is more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed, then doing.</p>
               <p>But be it as it will, this victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Devotion is such, that it hath gained our <hi>Kings</hi> the name of <hi>Most Christian,</hi> which was unknown be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and which must be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd against the use of all langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, for an honour to their victories and their zeale.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:205168:76"/>
               <p>The same Devotion hath recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved these Testimonies from the mouth of the supream Bishops; That God made use of the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> as of his Principall forces, and as an invincible Bulwark to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the <hi>Christian Republick:</hi> That their Kingdome was his Quiver, from whence he drew all his arrows with which he shoots against Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants. The same at this day deserves the same Elogies, &amp; carries the <hi>King</hi> to such high enterprises, that they cannot be drawn into example; And besides, the valour which is born with him, and which he hath gained by reason, a third kind of courage doth inspire him, which is a species of Divine fury, with which the <hi>Orthodox Princes</hi> have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bin agitated, when their bare presence hath put Armies to flight, and the Enemies have discovered something extraordinary in their faces, which they durst not resist.</p>

               <p>And if it be true that the innocence which our first Father lost, stamped upon him a character of Authority, which the wild beasts acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which made him be reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of what was most cruell and terrible in nature; I wonder not that a man, who by his vertue seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to have recovered this originall and ancient righteousnesse, have an advantage over other men, and that for the most part he finds submis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion where wicked men meet with
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:205168:77"/> resistance. I wonder not, that having a mind void of all remorse and teares which accompany sinne, he is extreamly valiant; and feeling neither trouble nor disorder in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, which makes a diversion of his thoughts, he fight with more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty then sinners, who are wearied and hurried w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

A troubled conscience presumes cruel things: Malice is fearefull, and given to a man for condemnation; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a <hi>Prince,</hi> who hath none but holy intentions, can have none but good hopes: Enterprises of the greatest danger are of no difficultie with him. He goeth with a firme belief, that what was not esteemed feasible by his <hi>Predecessors,</hi> is reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for his <hi>Pietie,</hi> and he is never in pain for the uncertainty of the event, because he is not engaged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the faith of an <hi>Almanack,</hi> and the propositions of an <hi>Astrologer,</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:205168:78"/> but he follows the <hi>Inspirations</hi> of the God of <hi>Christians,</hi> who in the same place where he is called <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father,</hi> is also called, <hi>The Counsellour.</hi> He rests him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self upon his word that cannot lye, and who hath promised those that serve him, to assist them visibly with his Angels. To go himself in person to be their sword and buckler, to hide them in his Tabernacle in the time of adversitie, and to preserve them in the secret place of his pavillion, to send his feare before them, and to affrighten all people against whom they shall come; to drive out Nations before them, and to divide the Land to them for an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance. But let the worst come, when these temporall promises shall not be punctually performed, and that good successe shall not of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity follow a good cause: When the <hi>Just shall not flourish as the Palme-tree, nor be lifted up as the

Moreover as, in the Law, he did not receive for an offering neither the price of a dog, nor the hire of an harlot; so under the Gospel he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires that Alms be given of those things which are lawfully gotten.

<pb n="81" facs="tcp:205168:81"/> to ravish from him persons who were dear unto him, and whom he would have ransomed with all the Jewels of his Crown, but whom he would not save by one word of weaknesse? In this occasion the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of three Constables, the merit of the blood of <hi>Montmorency,</hi> the valour of the top of that house, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes so dear and so necessary for <hi>France,</hi> have gained nothing upon him, but grief, for not being able to contribute any thing to so power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full considerations.</p>
               <p>He resisted the tears of <hi>Princesses,</hi> the prayers of the Court, his own will; as in other encounters, where the sweetnesse of revenge might seem lawfull, or where he might glut himself with the blood and slaughter of a whole people, he parted, for the love of the publick, with his just resentments, and eased himself by the same motive where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he was straitned; making it appear thorowout, that he moves
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:205168:82"/> only by the line of Reason, and that the <hi>King</hi> is so separated from the man, and the spirit hath so subdued the matter, that the Interests of his State retain in him at this day, the place of the passions of his soule. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch, that he cares not to extend his supream Authority further then needs must, since he confines him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self within civill Justice: He mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not to do that which is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, because he abstains from that which is permitted; He takes no care to indulge wicked desires, and to give up himself to pleasure, since he denyes many things to necessity and nature it self. In a word, he is not carefull to injoy those pleasures which are common to men with beasts, since he neglects those which are common to him with other men, and knows no contentments but those serious ones, which arise out of the satisfaction of a good conscience, and proceed from the glory of great actions, which are
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:205168:82"/> alwayes fresh and new, and which the Laws do not tolerate as Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of humane infirmity, but which wise men propose as the reward of Heroick vertue.</p>

               <p>I Know very well, that in this discourse, I esteem a vertue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned of the world; and that the most part of those who professe ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, will reproach me, that I praise men for the vertues of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; but I value not the opinions of so debauched an age as ours is.</p>
               <p>To go right, I go against the stream of the torrent, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent corruption. And since the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Word speaks what truth is, and not what Custome is, I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther speak truly, then according to the sense of many, and to hold my self to reason, however abandoned, then to Custome, though never so much followed.</p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:205168:83"/>
               <p>It is certain, that all bold acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not performed in the warr; There is required resolution and courage to be chast, and fair things are commonly more to be feared then evill things. Grief assaults the strongest part of our soule, where it meets with despite and anger which defend it: but pleasure combates the naked'st and weakest passages, where it finds nothing but self-love, which presently surrenders; And therefore, as it is not so hard a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to hold out within the wals, as to maintain a breach, so it is lesse to resist grief, then pleasure. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Religion agrees with Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phie: and forasmuch, as in the judgment of the Son of God, to root up concupiscence, is no lesse then to pluck out an eye, or to cut off a hand: And that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaks ordinarily of crucifying it, and saith, that our Affections are our Members: There are in the Church that have believed Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:205168:83"/> to be an unbloody Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and a persecution truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible, but the longest, most ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate, and most violent of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>I shall not be afraid therefore, to praise the <hi>King</hi> for his purity, because it makes up one part of his valour, and he owes it to the strength of his reason, not to the weaknesse of his appetites, and for that, the peace of his Conscience comes not from the impotency of his nature, but from the labour and conquest of his spirit; He is not ashamed that men know him to be <hi>King</hi> of himself, as well as of his people; That he is absolute within, as well as without, That he is above all kind of Enemies; That there is no combate, whether against stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, against his own Subjects, or against his passions, but he remains Master.</p>
               <p>Now it is without difficultie granted, that from these acts of
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:205168:84"/> valour, there grow such perfect joys that out of heaven he cannot receiv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And though he lost his life in the last of these two Journeys, nor could possesse his glory above half an houre, and that in the dolours of a mortall wound; He dyed notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing more happily, then the Effeminate live; and would not have exchanged one moment of that time, for their long and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable old age.</p>
               <p>But if <hi>Epicurus</hi> himself had the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:205168:84"/> courage to say, that vertue could not be miserable upon the wheele; That the remembrance of what was past, obliged him to confesse, that he found himself well there, and that the grief, which made his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners rage, did only tickle him; shall we doubt that in a calme con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and in a pure prosperity it doth not feel incomparable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, a thousand times more lively, more subtile, and more pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating, then all the effects of the most artificiall delights, which the wit of man hath invented to flatter the body?</p>
               <p>We embrace some objects in this world, which slide away and melt between our hands: which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually threatned with an end, or with a change, which we are assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red either suddenly to hate, or to contemne, or else to love no more. Their nature being to be corrupted, as soon as they are brought forth, the affection which we bear them,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:205168:85"/> vanisheth with them; and because they are not infinite, they must needs perish by their own growth; their desires ending by injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and their motion by we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse.</p>
               <p>Therefore, let us admire our wise <hi>Prince,</hi> that knows how to place his passions upon those objects which he may alwayes love, and which alwayes will be lovely; which are not defiled with the filth of earthly things, which raise his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to the highest and first beauty, estranging them from body and matter, as the dregs and impurity of the Creatures. Pleasure with all her inventions and allurements, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not gain upon him one beginning of a will, nor please him at all in sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prising him. He will sooner purifie the Court by his Example, then the Court corrupt him with its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights. In all his life there never proceeded one word out of his mouth, which might receive a
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:205168:85"/> dishonest meaning; nor was it possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to finish an immodest speech be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, for any man who should dare to begin it. The modesty of his Countenance, together with a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant mixture of sweetnesse and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which appear'd in his eyes, stifled evill thoughts in the very soules of men, and reform'd, at the first view, whatsoever approach'd him: so that in his presence, the most debauched resemble the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destest, and his bare look had pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er either to change, or to suspend their Inclination.</p>
               <p>So rare and difficult a vertue, is indeed the gift of heaven, and a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of his birth, but it is also an effect of his full manner of living, and the fruit of his continuall em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments. He gave vice neither means nor time to assault him; he never yet had leisure to do ill; and his evill Angel hath alwayes found him busie elsewhere, when he hath assay'd to carry him thither. If he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:205168:86"/> could not alwaies be in Warr, or at Counsel, yet his sports and recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were austere and toylsome, his delights martiall and virile. Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure cannot gain upon him by other charms, nor draw him to her but by labour. All his exercises serve for his principall profession; They have some relation or resemblance with Arms, and are either the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or the Meditations of Warr. The most part of <hi>Princes</hi> that we have known, and of whom we have heard speak, are not of this humor; they are not active with so much vigor as appeares in him at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxations, and the rest in which they languish is so shamefull, that it were more for their honour if it were a pure Lethargie. Some grow old at the Table and spend their dayes and nights in the pleasure of feasting: others imploy the third part of their life in curling their haires and consulting the glasse, and those that are most honestly
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:205168:86"/> imployed, bestow all their time and their wit, either in furnishing a Gallery with pictures, or in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting the essence of Iesimin, or in drawing a fountain some four leagues to adorne a Garden, or to calculate their traffick, or to hear the propositions of an Alchymist. They are hid many times at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of a Pallace, where their own happinesse disquiets them, where they complain of the misery of their condition, because there are no more new pleasures to be discovered: Or in the midst of their Treasures and delights, they become poor and lean by their desires, when with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are fatted as Victimes to be immolated: They are perfumed as bodies to be embalmed: They have Torches lighted to them at mid-day, that the Pomp of their life may be the beginning of the preparations to their Funerals, and when one passeth by their door, they may say with reason, <hi>Here
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:205168:87"/> lyes such a Prince.</hi> If at any time the noise of the victories of the <hi>King,</hi> awaken their lazie spirits; and if so lively a light pierce the thicknesse and obscurity of their prisons; perhaps they will come a little out of this profound slumber, and feel some light touch of glory: But the heart is not yet broken up, and these good motions produce onely faire wishes: Instead of imitating the vertue of so brave a <hi>Prince,</hi> they envie his fortune. If sometimes they dare indure the day, and undergo the hazard of see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sun, to which they are strange and unacquainted, never think that it is to take in hand some long journey, or in <hi>Person</hi> to assist their <hi>Allies,</hi> that they quit their darknesse and solitude; They go not out of their lodgings, but to make Love in the City, and to force that chastitie whicih resists, or to corrupt that which is inclinable to yeild. And at their departure from
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:205168:87"/> thence, when they have glutted their brutish passions; when they have violated the sanctity of <hi>Marriage,</hi> and dishonored poor <hi>Families,</hi> they call it sport, and seek good words to guild over villanous actions. Was there not one lately, who boasted he had triumphed over the fairest part of the world, speaking of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies he had loved? And did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother say he deserved the title of Father of his <hi>People,</hi> he got the most Children he could of the Wives of his <hi>Subjects?</hi> In these la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scivious and debauched Courts, the most sacred Dignities are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the recompence of a night, which the <hi>Prince</hi> hath spent plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly. Nothing is refused to the embracements of an artificiall wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who can make use of her charmes, nothing is impossible to her kisses. The least of her dalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances are able to pardon the guiltie, and procure the condemnation of the Innocent; and that which could
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:205168:88"/> not passe in the Counsel, receives no difficulty in the Bed.</p>
               <p>But God be thanked, we are secure from this misfortune, and our Court is pure from this defilement. The desire of true glory cannot sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist where there are smaller affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and in the heart of the <hi>King</hi> this ardent passion consummates, to speak truth, all the others; being so active as he is without ceasing, how can he dream of pleasure? and being, as he is, extreamly laborious, how should he fall into the sinne of sluggards? Whatsoever recreations are presented to him, they never withdraw his mind from the affairs of his Kingdome; and though he may cast a look sometimes upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther objects, yet his sight is still fixed there. What ever he doth, and to whatsoever he applies himself, he never forgets to raigne; he never lets down his <hi>Majestie</hi> into low employments, and unbeseeming his condition. His whole Life, is, as it
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:205168:88"/> were, equally serious.</p>

               <p>I doubt not, but he hath read with disdain, the History of <hi>King Renes, Count</hi> of <hi>Provence,</hi> who was found finishing the picture of a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tridge, by the man that brought him the news of the losse of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Scicilie:</hi> And I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that if <hi>Selim</hi> Emperour of the <hi>Turks,</hi> in a Tablet which he made and published, had not pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:205168:89"/> a battle which he had gain'd, he would hardly have pardoned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, for letting the world know he was a Painter. Not that he is averse to curiosities, or an Enemy to neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and innocent inventions, which comfort and sweeten the vexations of this life; For contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he beholds distinctly in the Arts, those beauties and graces which are hid to us. He discovers in the workmanship, that which is more subtile and spirituall; That which is separated from the rest, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains nothing of the matter; that which easily escapes a sight not purged by an exact and subtile knowledge.</p>
               <p>And indeed, it is not without reason, that we laugh at the rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of those <hi>Princes,</hi> one of which, thought the neighing of his horse more pleasant then any Musick; Another prefer'd the smell of Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick before the artificiall skill of <hi>Perfumers.</hi>

               <p>A Lord of <hi>Saxony</hi> walking in the Galleries of the Market at <hi>Rome,</hi> stood still at a Picture which he saw every man admiring, where was represented a great withered man, full of age and diseases, who leaned upon a staffe: But as the Merchant, who thought to make a fortune by the sale of that rare piece, ask'd him how he lik'd his old man, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered innocently, he did not at all like it, and that he would never have it, though a man would give it him for nothing.</p>
               <p>And in the memory of our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, when our <hi>Pope Adrian,</hi> the sixth, was shewn <hi>Laocoon,</hi> at the Garden of <hi>Belveder,</hi> and some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Reliques of the <hi>Roman</hi> magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, he commanded in anger that they should take away those <hi>Pagan</hi> Idols from before him, and was ready to have it made lime to build some ruinous places of the wals of the City. In these uncivill and injurious contempts of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:205168:90"/> there is either a grosse and bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish ignorance, or a presumptuous and froward severity; and to be lesse then a <hi>Scythian,</hi> you cannot blame the <hi>King;</hi> for having the senses, which have the most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with the Spirit, naturally very pure, and to have gained the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most perfection by Art and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. You cannot blame him for see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearing with knowledg, and for having the hands ready and ingenious, and to be able to draw a Combate upon a Cloath, or to paint a Siege which he shall come to make. He will only let the world know, that he understands many things, which he doth not busie himself in; That he can deeply judge of the profession of others, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly discharge his own; and that he doth not hate the Muses and their honest exercises, but that warr and his affairs allow him no liberty, to bestow any time in them. It is certain, that the Principall <hi>Science</hi> of
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:205168:91"/> Kings ought to have for its object <hi>Royalty:</hi> Their <hi>Philosophy</hi> ought to be Practicall, and to quit the shade and Gardens, where they spend a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant and obscure life, to appear in the Lists and great Theater of the world, covered over with sweat and dust; Their study ought not to be imploy'd in seeking out unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble verities, which make those that find them out, neither better nor happier then they were; It must labour for the acquisition of active vertues, and such as are necessary for the world; such as work out the happinesse of the State, and not the bare contentments of the mind, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king experience of those things which the Schools can only dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course of.</p>

The <hi>Kings</hi> knowledge farr exceeds all that, and his Art is more noble, though he do not exercise it with so much pomp and ostentation: He understands that Science, under whose protection all others are safe, and every society of men maintains it self; The <hi>Science,</hi> I mean, of <hi>Governing:</hi> He will not dispute the glory of Language with his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the Authors of his time; But he can contend for that of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and Justice, with his Ancestors, and all Antiquity.</p>
               <p>The former <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> who were <hi>Demy-Gods,</hi> and not Men, were lesse knowing then he: They went not to <hi>Athens</hi> to learn words and subtleties, nor did desire to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr

               <p>It would have bin a hard matter, to have observed distinctly in their discourse, the parts of Eloquence, and to separate the <hi>Exordium</hi> from the Narration, and the Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Epilogue; They ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd themselves only, as it were, by <hi>Monosyllables,</hi> and if they could have bin understood without taking the pains to speak, they would have spared themselves those few words they then made use of.</p>

               <p>Some of his Predecessors had more adoe to move themselves, and to passe from their Chamber to their Closet, then he to go from one end of the Kingdome to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He makes his Galleries and his Walkes from <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Guyenna,</hi> or the <hi>Dauphine:</hi> and there is not any part of the State afflicted, be it never so remote, which having dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered its wounds and made him acquainted with its distresse, doth not presently feel the comfort which his <hi>Presence</hi> brings where e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it shews it self.</p>
               <p>For this end, <hi>Nature</hi> hath given him a Body which doth not at all oppresse his mind; &amp; being extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly active and vigorous, finds not much difficulty to follow the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his courage.</p>
               <p>The continuall Agitation in

He is free from those hinderances which effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate Men either make or find, and which are the cause of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table losse of time, which to a <hi>Prince</hi> ought to be the most preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing in the world, and of which he may be covetous without loosing the Title of Liberall. If the <hi>King</hi> did not know how to use it with much Oeconomie, and were not an excellent Steward of so frail a good, and of so had a Guard, he had not, as he hath done, in lesse then six years, begun, pursued and ended a labour which in all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance might have bin the excer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of his successors, and have continued to his Posteritie. He had not bin <hi>Master</hi> at home, and Judge amongst his Neighbours, nor had he quenched, as he hath, Rebellion; disarmed Error, upheld weaknesse, abased Tyranny. A <hi>Prince</hi> indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renly diligent, had bin yet but the halfe way of so painfull a journey,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:205168:101"/> and under another <hi>King</hi> then ours, we should yet make prayers to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at that Haven, in which now we give thanks for our safety.

Let us avow upon all occasions, the obligation we have to the <hi>King,</hi> if we cannot acknowledg them. Never was there seen so great a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to happinesse, as the <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians</hi> seek for; Never were fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture promises so faire: We no more feare the ruine of our State; we hope for Eternity. All the pieces of this proud <hi>Lump,</hi> which hath tottered so long, are now firm; all is inclosed with an admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evennesse; not one stone jets out beyond its line and levell; Nothing offends the eies of the most curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: See here the first time that detraction shall be mute. There
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:205168:101"/> are no more faults to discover, there are scarce any more wishes to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished. Certainly I suspect my eyes, and can hardly believe my self, when I consider the present, and remember what is past.

Under the same visages I behold other Men, and in the same Kingdome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other State; The ancient shape re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines, but the inside is renewed. There is a Morall revolution, a change of the mind, a sweet and pleasant transition from bad to good.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> hath put his Subjects in reputation, hath communicated his strength and vigor to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick, hath corrected the faults of the pass'd age, hath banished all softnesse, and rashnesse in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:205168:102"/> of affaires.

Our Lightnesse, our Inconstancy; our Folly is turned to a Proverb. They say <hi>France</hi> was a Ship, whose Pilot was the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest. Our Fathers managed their Wars without Discipline, their negotiations without secrecy: Their fashion to act, was as much without rule, as if they had had a designe to loose in all Treaties; and their valour so hardy, as if they had fought blind-fold. Therefore they bequeathed us that which they had governed ill, and their estate came to us in this confusion and disorder. All <hi>Maximes,</hi> generally received for true, have been found false, in what concerns us: All the signes
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:205168:103"/> of a certain death have been in vain, when they have appeared upon us. Al forraign wisedome hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the judgement which it made concerning the continuance of our Monarchie.</p>
               <p>After the imprisonment of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Francis,</hi> which were to both the fruit of their own imprudence, there were all the appearances in the world, that the Kingdome would change its Master, and would be no longer but a Province of our enemies: Yet behold it still under the power of the lawfull Heire of those brave Prisoners. The Kings of <hi>England,</hi> who have raigned, and were crowned at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> had lately but one Embassador here, and now have none at all. There remaines nothing to them of all the conquests they have made, but a uselesse name, which we leave to them to adorne their Titles, and to comfort them for their losses. And after so many Battles gained,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:205168:103"/> I know not what made them flie, and chased them out of a Countrey, where they believed themselves at home, and where there were not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove three or four Towns that were <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spaine</hi> having had, as it were, the same advantages, sees its self de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd by the same event. We o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd them all our Gates, we recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Garrisons into our Cities, their Ministers into our Counsel; The most part of our people, if they had been borne at <hi>Madrid,</hi> or at <hi>Toledo,</hi> could not have been better <hi>Spaniards</hi> then they were; and the whole Nation ran in Troops hood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winckt to bondage: yet these dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions to a change, and these advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of a Victory, were of no use to <hi>Philip,</hi> nor his <hi>Infanta;</hi> We have not been able to lose, that which we have given: We could not fall under a forraign power, though ruine were our own design. The chaines which we demanded were
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:205168:104"/> demanded were denied us, and our Countrey remained to us, after we had delivered it to our enemy.</p>
               <p>In other places, there needs only a Civil Warr to break a State in pieces, and to abolish Monarchie; But what have we seen but Civil Warrs since the death of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second? Nay, have they not been so frequent, that for a long time we may count the yeares by the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Peace which have bin made? Our Kings signed the Arrests of their death, or at least of their Deposing, when they signed the League, and when of two Factions, that rent the Kingdome, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered their Arms and Authority to one, that so they might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd and naked against the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises of both: If they had bin go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by reason, they had never committed such a fault; And if there had bin any Prudence in those times, there had bin neither League nor <hi>Hugonotes.</hi> This last party,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:205168:104"/> which was to be stifled in the cradle, when it was but half formed, and the weakest hands might have spoil'd it, increas'd so by the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the <hi>Soveraign,</hi> and took its first vigor from the contempt which Men had of its weaknesse; and at length ascended to so prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious a greatnesse, that it hath often ballanced the Royall Forces, till it fell out, that its ruine was the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster-piece</hi> of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Just.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But before this Generous <hi>Prince</hi> was come into the world, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish our safety, and to stop things at the very point where they ought to stand, how many times have these two potent Factions fail'd of their blow? How little was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but that we had seen a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of <hi>Languedoc?</hi> And that it had not bin the States of <hi>Guyenna?</hi> That there had not bin made Dukes of <hi>Burgundy</hi> and Counts of <hi>Provence?</hi> And who could assure our Fathers, but Rebellion expected
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:205168:105"/> to make its last and utmost assaults against him, who was only able to destroy them?</p>
               <p>We have alwayes bin the work men and the Engineers of our own misfortune: Our Enemies have built their Bulwarks, and raised their Forts under the shadow of our <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Treaties;</hi> They have grown great, and maintained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under our protection: They have grown warm, and bin nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our bosome: The weaknesse and Cowardlinesse of the <hi>Masters,</hi> hath bin the cause of the boldnesse and undertakings of the Servants. All the State resented the victories and the lazinesse of the <hi>Cabinet;</hi> From the contempt which the <hi>Prince</hi> made of his charge, spring that which others made of his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority: He had bin obeyed, if he had known how to rule.</p>
               <p>Amongst us, neither the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor the reward have scarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bin known. The Great ones
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:205168:105"/> have alwayes freely injured the small: The weak have alwayes bin the spoile and prey of the stronger; Men have alwayes trod upon those who have thrown themselves down: Good men have alwayes bin dispised, because none have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken pains to preserve them, nor had any fear to destroy them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Aristophon</hi> brag'd at <hi>Athens,</hi> that he had bin accused seventy five times, and had so many times cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Judges: Here wicked men have thriven most prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rously: They have not only injoy'd Impunity, They have had rewards bestowed upon them: They have bin sought after with great care, and handled with all kind of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour: They have alwaies got by the practice of wickednesse, and have profited by their faults; Those that deserved the severest punishment, have had the freest payment; and we have seen an old sinner, who shewed three houses which he had
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:205168:106"/> got by the money which the <hi>King</hi> had given him, for having bin in three Conspiracies against his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; so that neither he, nor his companions, had any need to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of so good a Crime, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse Rebellion to be a wicked en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprise, since they got such notable commodities thereby, and it was so liberally rewarded.</p>
               <p>This was not to raign; this was not to overcome; That which was done in those dayes, was not to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, it was to live only, and to passe on from one day to another. The state of affairs, was neither Warr nor Peace, nor a Truce; it was a rest of slumber, which was artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially procur'd to the people; and the sleep of Criminals and of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged persons, is not more disturb'd, nor more unquiet, then this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull tranquilitie. They knew not how to heale, they could only skin over the wound, and set a good face on the matter.</p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:205168:106"/>
               <p>Those that governed, would make Rebellion familiar in cares<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it; they cloy'd it with good turns and gratuities, but there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they made it more potent, and not better; they augmented its strength, and did not diminish its malice; sometimes they deprived it of some men who were to be sold, and of some advantages which it made no use of; and knew not that it was to prune disorder, thus gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to touch its branches and its slips, and not to lay the Axe to its Trunck and root.</p>
               <p>All high enterprises made them afraid; all great things appeared to them monstrous; whatever was not easie, they cal'd it impossible. Fear made the objects seem bigger, and multiplying every individuall almost to an infinity, when three <hi>Male-contents</hi> retir'd from Court with their Train, they apprehended an Army of Rebels in the field, which drew the City and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:205168:107"/> after them, without finding any resistance: Whereupon, they put not themselves in a posture to chastise them, but used means to sooth them, and instead of going to visite them with Cannons and Souldiers, they sent them Lawyers with offers and Conditions, and promised them much more then they could hope for from their victorie.</p>
               <p>Thus the goodnesse of the <hi>Prince</hi> was a certain Income and Revenue to wicked men; He squeezed his own Coffers to give pay to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and every day paid for something which he never got. At the least Rumor he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended from his <hi>Throne,</hi> to treat with his Subjects; of a Soveraign he made himself a private person, and of a Law-Giver, became an Advocate.</p>
               <p>By this breach, the partition, which separated him from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was broken down, and the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:205168:107"/> Power changed into an Equalitie: The Guiltie sate upon the Tribunall, and deliberated of their own fact with their Judge: They named the place of Conference, and it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of: They chose to conferr with Persons in whom they most confided, and those were given them that they liked best of. There was not a word of Grace or Pardon; Those tearms were too rude, and had injur'd their ears: But the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended <hi>Master</hi> declared solemnly, that all was done for the good of his Service, and acknowledg'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self extreamly beholding to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfull servants, for the affronts he had received from them.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the design of the <hi>Cabinet</hi> being but to seperate the Allies, and to turn aside the present storm, they granted them more then they could ask; They were prodigall of the Publick faith. The Name of <hi>King</hi> was not at all mentioned to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:205168:108"/>

               <p>It is an old deboist Body, that hath done what it could to dye, and yet lives in spight of the Physitians. Fortune hath corrected all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faults of our Government: Chance hath saved; us or to speak of our happinesse more Christianly, and to leave the termes of corrupt use, which savour yet of <hi>Paganisme;</hi> God hath taken a particular care of desolate forsaken <hi>France,</hi> and was willing to be her <hi>Helper</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of her affaires.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Providence</hi> hath alwayes fought against the imprudence of men; Heaven hath wrought as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny miracles, as they committed faults: yet we must not love dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, nor persevere in wickednesse, in hope of a miraculous succour. We must not say, that God is obliged by oath, to make all our falls prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, nor that he will blesse all our Follies, nor that he will trouble
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:205168:109"/> himself to give good successes to all our evill Counsels. At last, he permits effects to follow their Causes, and that That which hath a long time troubled the order of the world, and violated the universall Law, do enter into its ordinary course, whence it hath proceeded, and obey that common necessitie which he hath imposed upon the Actions of his Creatures.</p>
               <p>But in the condition we are now in, the storm will take us in a good houre; we can let passe this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary assistance, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not alwayes promise our selves: we will no more tempt God by a rash confidence, nor sleep in danger, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting supports from Heaven; and now, that there is no more attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for our faults, we have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to fear, being assured not to fail any more. Yet it hath not bin inconvenient, that things did not arrive all at once to their highest pitch; It was necessary to come by
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:205168:109"/> many degrees to <hi>Lewis the Just:</hi> To this <hi>Prince,</hi> who possessing rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in a transcendent degree, ought to raign by right of nature, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the opinion of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> when he did not raign by <hi>Divine Right,</hi> according to the Principles of our Faith.</p>
               <p>It was reasonable, we should more then once ask Heaven for so necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a <hi>Reformer;</hi> who by a Direction full of force, hath turned the affairs from that evill course they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and conquered that long cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome we had of disorder; who hath carried the Regall Authoritie as high as it could go, without <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny;</hi> who hath both punished and rewarded with exquisite choise and discretion, that so he might avoid Cruelty, and not fall into weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: Who hath brought Discipline to Warr, and secrecie to Counsell: Who hath reduc'd our faith and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to a good savour among other Nations, and hath made those
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:205168:110"/> that resisted our Forces, to render themselves to his Sincerity: who hath changed those petty-slights which we made use of to catch the meanest of the Subjects, into his great and couragious <hi>Maximes,</hi> which give Law to <hi>King</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes;</hi> who lastly (which my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Interest renders more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable to me then all the rest) came to finish upon the edge of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> a work, whose only fashion and attempt made us fear; and knew to take his measures so just, his Time so proper to the design he went about, that sooner or latter, it had not bin possible to have brought it to passe.</p>

               <head>CHAP. XVI.</head>
               <p>IN this, the clearnesse of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding hath chiefly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: To do extraordinary things, it is not enough to know how to
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:205168:110"/> employ opportunities well, but also to know how to chuse them. Civill Prudence, as well as Judiciary Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie, is acquainted with good and bad houres, according to which it either rests, or labours. All Actions of men have their seasons; even the most vertuous may be done unseasonably. And forasmuch as that which is but an Accident to naturall, is Essentiall to Morall things, there needs nothing but a light Circumstance of time, or place, to spoyle a businesse which in it selfe was most profitable and reasonable. Sometimes to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishing of our designe, there needs nothing but that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse of our Enemies be at the full; That the bad influence which bare rule, beginning to be weakned, There is no more resistance in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of heaven, and that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be come in which it pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God to suffer Men to be made. And as Travellers who rise at
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:205168:111"/> Moon-light, supposing that it is day, are constrained to lye down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, or venture the danger of missing their way if they goe on in their journey: In like manner those that follow the meer light of appearances, and who undertake things out of season, are in danger either to gain nothing, or else to be lost in their Enterprises.</p>
               <p>Now if ever man knew to take the precise point of time, which is as hard to be met with as that just degree of heat which <hi>Chymists</hi> seek for in the operation of their <hi>Secret,</hi> If every man were able to discern the houre of execution, and to make his Benefit of the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it must be confessed it is <hi>This Prince</hi> of whom I speak.</p>
               <p>Assoon as ever this opportunity, which is so necessary in policy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to appear, and he perceives that his affairs are ripe, he will not suffer the fruit to be spoil'd; He makes the least moments available
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:205168:111"/> His <hi>Presence</hi> gives heat to the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; he animates the workmen by his very look, his voyce and incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements.</p>
               <p>You see with what Courage and Magnanimitie he performes busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses, with what bravery he beares himself in danger: with what Confidence he considers Death, and prepares himself for all events; with what severitie of Countenance he rejects fearfull Counsells, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and distrustfull wisdome. It is certain, that in the conduct of Affaires, Courage is no lesse neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to judgment to put it on, then judgment is necessary to Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit to hold it in. And as the Mind, all alone, commits many faults, and will unadvisedly remove heaven and earth; so judgment, all alone, is voyd of Action, and is the most idle and barren part of a man. It hinders him from falling, but it is by counselling him to sit still, and not goe at all: It makes a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:205168:112"/> ill weather, but it is by cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him to keep his chamber: It spends dayes and nights in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and from these reasonings proceed nothing but doubts and suspicions, and a miserable unresol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vednesse, which is the Cause that he never undertakes any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he will enter upon nothing that is hazardous. Therfore it is, that Chance meets us every where, and there is no businesse so certain, over which Fortune hath not some right, and which is not subject at least to an Inconvenience.</p>
               <p>He that alwaies observes the winds and the Clouds shall not sow, nor reape. The idle fellow be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he will not go, sayth a Lyon is in the way, and a Lyonesse not far off.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> contrarily, when he hath laid his design, troubles his mind no more with an impotunate reasoning, nor enters into conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations which have no end: He
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:205168:112"/> leaves off to deliberate, when it is time to be doing; He doth not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow his first opinions by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, nor those by other new one. He is not troubled to combate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, when he is to go against his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie: When he hath undertaken a journey, nothing is got by oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him. He is as firme in his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary resolution, as men are in their ancient Habits: Obstacles which present themselves do not stop him, provided that humane force can vanquish them: Even those that come from a higher cause, from absolute necessity, have much ado to give him check; and if he be constrained sometimes to yield to the violence of grief, and that he be acquainted with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmitie of our condition, herein he is more tormented with his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, then with his pain. In the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity of a burning Feaver, he complains only of the daies and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions which he loseth; he is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:205168:113"/> at nothing, but the going back of his affaires. He will part with all his good intervals to it, instead of tarrying for the effect of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the recovery of his health: he employes the stops of his disease to be convey'd to his Army; he leaves himself to be cured in the Warr; and with a Body, which hath but half its strength, he laieth the foundation of the hardest enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise of this our Age. Knowing very well, that the same advantages seldome offer themselves twice to the same person; he puts not off af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires till to morrow, nor loses good successe by delay: He never saies ther's enough for this time, and we shall finish the rest at leisure. This is Gods proceeding, who is thus patient, because he is Eternall, and lets wicked men alone some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, because he hath another world wherein to punish them. But we must not propose an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to men, which they cannot fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low;
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:205168:113"/> They do not make occasions, but receive them: They do not command the times; they possesse but a small part of them, only the present, which is a point almost imperceptible, oppos'd to that vast extent of Eternity, which hath no bounds. To arrive at their butt, they must go apase and beginn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times. They must make hast thorow suddain and transitory things.</p>
               <p>And that wise <hi>Prince,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the knowledg which he might draw from his own experience and reason; was enlightned of God, said, speaking of himself, that he slew the wicked betimes in the morning; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, as I conceive, he was not as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd of the after-noon, and knew not if his good fortune would last so long.</p>

               <p>THese <hi>Maximes</hi> are necessary in the height of a Tempest, and in the greatest extreamities, but they may be made use of when we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any sign of change, and the least presage of a storme. Neither doth the <hi>King</hi> throw himself abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely upon these kinds of encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; though during the calme and in a full peace, he have some more mild and humane dispositions. Sometimes he speedily opposeth force against prepared violence, and hath made light skirmishes to avoid greater combates. Perhaps he hath made <hi>France</hi> lesse by two or three heads, whereof the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique rest had need, for its esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment; and his Clemency hath not allwaies overcome his justice. We remember what past upon the <hi>Louver Bridge,</hi> at that fatall season, when he had scarce any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:205168:114"/> for himself, but himself, he was constrained to call home to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the power to condemne which <hi>Princes</hi> have committed to others, and to resume that troublesome part of Regall Authoritie, which they discharg'd upon the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> An unfortunate Stranger had so confounded things, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled his owne Interests with those of the State, that none but the <hi>King</hi> could separate them, and cleare the world of the truth of his service: He resolved therfore to declare himself, and to purge the Court of that shamefull domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which was established upon the ruines of <hi>Majestie,</hi> and which he seemed to approve by his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. He conceived, that day, the design for the safety of his State, and by the death of two Serpents, made us hope the ruine of that <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra</hi> which we begin to see at his last gasp. If he that was nam'd the mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest and meekest man upon the
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:205168:115"/> earth, Divine <hi>Moses,</hi> being yet a private man, and having then no Authority, but only seeing the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of his Brethren, believed he was obliged to succour them, and to begin the deliverance of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by the slaughter of an <hi>Egyptian,</hi> who smote an <hi>Israelite:</hi> With how much more reason might the <hi>King,</hi> to whom God hath given the sword, and who only hath right of life and death, make use of that right to punish a Tyrant, who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest his true and lawfull Subjects; who thirsted after the bloud of his Princes; who held his Court in Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and in hope devoured his whole Kingdome? Yet Posterity shall see very few of these examples in his Story. He used no supream Authority, but against those who would usurp; it nor let fall any thunder-bolts, but upon those that would snatch them out of his hands. He hath not consented to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of Criminalls, but when
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:205168:115"/> there was no other way left to put an end to their faults. He kills not, nor takes pleasure to see persons put to death, not even the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths Enemies; but he tries what he can to make them good Citizens, and good Subjects: At least he provides that wicked men be not dangerous to the publick, and without depriving them of life, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives them of power and venome. His power is now such, that if three Mutinies joyn together against the State, he hath foure meanes to scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter them; but his prudence is such on the other side, that they seldome come thus far, nor have scarce lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to become altogether guilty: He surpriseth them between the thought, and the execution of a fault. They believe their contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance very secret, yet he knowes as much of their news, as if he had bin president at their Counsel, They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate how to cast themselves into danger, and he hath already provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:205168:116"/> for their safety; They would lift their hand to strike their blow, and they find it seiz'd upon; They imagin presently they shall share the Kingdome, and they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves fast in a Chamber of the <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stile.</hi> The <hi>King,</hi> who hardly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to violent remedies, makes use sometimes of gentle preservatives: He hath found that excellent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per between punishment and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; He hath taken the mean be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Rigor and Indulgency; And to say truth, me thinks it is very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable to go before certain faults, which cannot be punished after they are committed, and not to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to correct a mischief, when the guilty are become Masters of their Judges.</p>
               <p>It is true, that commonly out of a foolish pitty, single men are fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, who enterprise against their Princes, because, in all causes, the more powerfull are accounted the most outragious; and it is usually
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:205168:116"/> presum'd, that injury proceeds ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from force, then weaknesse. People will not believe that men have conspired against <hi>Kings,</hi> till they see the Conspiracy brought to execution, and the Conspirators dead: Yet I do not counsel them to suffer themselves to be kil'd, to justifie their distrust; nor to fall into snares that are lai'd for them, to shew they doe not fear amisse: They may prevent danger, by the death of those they do suspect; it is an excusable severity: But it is a goodnesse which cannot be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently praised, and which is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the <hi>King,</hi> to do the same thing, and not to make a person die.</p>
               <p>Upon a bare suspicion, a light surmise, upon a dream which the <hi>Prince</hi> hath made, why shall it not be permitted him to secure himself of his factious Subjects, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort his mind, in giving them rest for their trouble? Why shall not
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:205168:117"/> a faithfull servant suffer with joy his detention, who giving place to a thing in contestation, shall make his innocency more clearly appear, and convince the Calumnie of his Enemies, and pacifie the disquiets of his <hi>Master?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not much better to hinder Innocents from falling, then to be brought to this sad necessity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the guilty? To do thus, is it not to exercise acts of <hi>Mercy?</hi> Is it not, for the most part, to preserve those that would destroy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves? If this easie means had bin alwayes used, to divert misfortunes which threaten the State, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of one particular had not often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bin the ruine of a whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; If the Authors of our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders had been opportunely seised upon, besides that so the first had bin saved, they had spared a great number of others lives, and all the blood which hath bin shed during these Civill warrs: If the ill-winds
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:205168:117"/> had bin shut up, the Sea had not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; If Kings had prudence enough, they would have nothing to do but Justice.</p>
               <p>I speak of that punctuall and scrupulous Justice, which will not remedy the Crimes which are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be committed, because they are not put into forme; which will stay till the Rebels have ruined the State, that so they may proceed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them lawfully; which to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve some termes of a Law, will suffer all Laws to perish: This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream right, is an extream injustice, and it would be a sin against reason, not to sin herein against formes: If the vertues did not help one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they would be imperfect and defective: <hi>Prudence</hi> must ease Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice in many things, and that this, or that make speed; he that goes too slow will never arrive; she must hinder those mischiefs, whose pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment would be impossible, or dangerous.</p>
               <pb n="154" facs="tcp:205168:118"/>
               <p>Justice is exercised only upon the Actions of men, but <hi>Prudence</hi> hath a right over their thoughts, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretest Intention; she extends her self very farr before what is to come; she respects the publick Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest; she provides for the good of posteritie; and to this end, she is constrained here and there, to make use of means which the Laws have not ordained, but which necessity justifieth, and which would not be good if they were not carried to a good end.</p>
               <p>The Publick profit is many times rais'd out of particular mens losses. The North wind purgeth the ayr, though it throw down trees, &amp; ruine houses. We recover life by absti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, by grief, by the losse of some one member, which we willingly part with to save the whole.</p>
               <p>Though the <hi>King</hi> hath preserved the Dignity and reputation of the Crown, in those conjunctures of time, when others would have
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:205168:118"/> thought it enough, not to have lost the State, though in the exteamity of evill, he would not, if it had bin possible, make use of one Remedy which had bin unpleasing; Though, in a word, he be infinitly sensible of the misery and complaints of his people, yet he could not chuse but make them grow lean in healing them, nor draw out of his own veins and substance, wherewith to procure their health.</p>
               <p>But short pains are willingly to be indured, when they produce long prosperities: We cannot with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour desire to be discharged of a burthen which we bear equally with our <hi>Master;</hi> and in an occasion where the <hi>Prince</hi> employs all his own, and spares not his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; It is very just, that Subjects should do something for their part, and that there should be none lazie or idle in his State, while he takes pains and endangers himself. The <hi>Romane Ladies</hi> once threw all their
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:205168:119"/> Jewels into a great pit, which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it self in the middle of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, imagining to stop it by that means: and <hi>Those</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in an urgent necessity, cut off their hair, and gave it to the publick, to make cords for Engines of Warr; and if this be so, are not we very delicate to complain, and very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just to murmure?</p>
               <p>Must the <hi>French</hi> have more pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion for their silver, then the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> and <hi>Carthaginians</hi> had for their ornaments and beauty? And shall we be afraid to become poor to save our Countrey, when women are content to be unhandsome for this end?</p>
               <p>We have this comfort at least, that it is not the Ryot of our <hi>Prince</hi> that spends our sweat and labour, and that the entertainment of his pleasure costs no body any thing. The money which he draws from his Kingdome to rigg his Navie, and to maintain Armies, is not diverted
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:205168:119"/> to other uses, nor employ'd to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate <hi>Masques</hi> and present <hi>Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He doth not as the Governours of <hi>Athens,</hi> who according to the Calculation of an ancient Author, spent more to have <hi>Medea, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone,</hi> the <hi>Phaenicians,</hi> and the <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantes</hi> acted, then to make a warr against the <hi>Persians,</hi> and defend the Empire of <hi>Greece.</hi> For some late years, expenses have indeed bin ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great, but they have bin ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; The people hath paid much, but it hath bin their own ransome, and we cannot buy the liberty of our Countrey at too dear a price, nor the quietnesse of our Posterity, to whom we bequeath no such sad imployment.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> hath in a small time levied millions, but also in a small time he hath managed many warrs, he hath defeated many parties, he hath taken many Towns, he hath cleansed many Provinces.</p>

               <p>ANd here I find my self, before I am aware, at the same place where I began; I am fallen into my first discourse I know not how. We must not once more admire the diligence of the <hi>King,</hi> who to the greatnesse of his Actions, hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded this grace, to do them spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily.</p>
               <p>Herein certainly appears some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more then humane; He uses the highest and most excellent waies of working; He seems to act in an instant, and that already he retains something of a glorified body, to which agility is no lesse proper then light: The quicknesse of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons troubles the sight and the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of the beholders that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them: The Issue of one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign is the passage to another; The change of labour serves him instead of repose; That which we think
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:205168:120"/> should be the end, is but a means to arrive thither.</p>
               <p>Who would not believe, but he would refresh himself after a siege of fifteen moneths, and that his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit might be satisfied with routing the <hi>English</hi> Army, and with the taking of <hi>Rochel?</hi> Had he not wherewith to entertain himself long enough with the Memory of two such famous actions; to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished with fruits which were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be gathered, and to injoy, at his ease, the reputation which he had gotten? Yet he had rather use the victory then injoy it; and deprive himself of the reward for doing well, rather then lose one occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of persevering.</p>
               <p>Behold him then, who is but half dry of the sweat of warr, who is yet covered with the dust of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix;</hi> who hath not finished his complements to the Queens: See him, I say, who no sooner return'd from <hi>Rochel,</hi> but he goes from <hi>Paris</hi>
                  <pb n="164" facs="tcp:205168:121"/> to put <hi>Italy</hi> into Liberty: Behold him who presseth Fortune without giving her any rest, who will not suffer his prosperity to languish, but pursues the favours of heaven, and forceth those affairs by his courage, which he had formerly wearied by his patience. Without doubt, good successes do not end with the Action that gives them birth, they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue after they are brought to passe; and leaving in the heart of <hi>Princes,</hi> a spurr to incite them, pusheth them out of their Throne, assoon as they offer to sit down upon it.</p>
               <p>The designs which have succeeded well, beget new thoughts in them to enterprise new things, and gives them the desire of a new reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if the first were already wholly spent; And as the most part of Lovers look not upon their <hi>Mistres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> when they are become their wives, so they contemn their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent glory, when it costs them no more pains to gain it.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:205168:121"/>
               <p>This passion in the soule of the <hi>King,</hi> is nothing else but the Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of himself; a Jealousie of his own merit; An obstinacy alwayes to conquer himself; the hope of what is to come, continually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating the reputation already pass'd; and the envie of what he is about to undertake, that which he hath already undertaken.</p>
               <p>He went down from the <hi>Alpes</hi> in the midst of winter, and by a memorable Battle, whose particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars I reserve for another place, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king sure of a passage which they would dispute, and snatching the keys out of the hands of the <hi>Porters,</hi> he open'd the Prisons to a whole captive Nation, and made them that complain'd of Tyrants, know that their Deliverer was come.</p>
               <p>At the noise of so great a news, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> withdrew their Troops from <hi>Mountferrat,</hi> aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning the labour of many moneths, and losing the glory of
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:205168:122"/> that Constancy, which their Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers so often oppose to our light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
               <p>It is in vain that so many prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives are made, and that they have travers'd so much ground. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of a long siege remains use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse: They fear more for <hi>Milan,</hi> then they hope for <hi>Cazal;</hi> and as there is nothing so contagious, nor which runneth so fast, as fear, the troubled imagination presenting the last evils first, and the extreamity of things; They tremble already in the Castles of <hi>Naples;</hi> and the Garrison of <hi>Palermo</hi> finds not the narrow Sea large enough, which parteth <hi>Scicilie</hi> from <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>King,</hi> in the mean time, is content to raise the dejected spirits, and to humble the proud; he will not be happy for himself, having fought only for his friends, nor make any profit from their warrs, his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being not mercenary. He lets his pretences sleep for a while, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:205168:122"/> the rights of his Crown, which he will not mingle with their affairs, that the assistance which he gives them, may be of pure gratuity; and that there may seem no neerer, or more particular Interest then that of their safety, nor that he will make use of a lesse enterprise to spare a greater.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> did not assist their Allies with the like freedome, nor like him embrace honest things, for the bare respect of honesty: Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular private men were vertuous, but the Republick was unjust. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit which they contemned at home, was the end and scope of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sultations in the <hi>Senate;</hi> and though they gave fair names to their enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prises, and coloured them with a seeming Generosity, yet they were full of Interests, and went, if not altogether straight on, yet some by-way to the advancement of their Empire.</p>
               <p>In the cause of the people who
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:205168:123"/> called them, they had alwaies their design apart; Almost all their usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations began by defending the good of another; and in succouring the weak against the stronger, they gain'd one part of the land, and conquer'd the other.</p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> doth not traffique thus with his courtesies and benefits, and his valour is neither covetous nor ambitious; After the service of God, and the generall good of Christendome, which are his first objects, he only labours for glory and reputation: He seeks for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Recompence for what he doth, but the lustre which redounds from his action, and the good savour it leaves behind; He was not invited to his neighbours, but by the only consideration of their need, and his own honour; nor carried his armes out of his Kingdome, but to make them know the difference of <hi>Princes,</hi> to their benefit; to receive with Authority the complaints of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted;
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:205168:123"/> to preserve right to those that have it, and to do Justice to all the world.</p>
               <p>This is certainly to be called a <hi>King,</hi> and to hold the place of God upon earth; this is to exercise a healthfull power to all people, and which suffers with all formes of Government; It is to embrace, with a common protection, that which is far off as well as that which is neer; It is to give, with an intent not to take: And just as the <hi>Eagle</hi> in the <hi>Fable,</hi> carryed <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymede</hi> into heaven, without either scratching his skin, or tearing his garments; so he makes strangers perceive the happinesse of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, without offending That of their Liberty, nor touching any thing that is dear unto them. The <hi>Princes</hi> that live thus, are to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed much more then Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and those that aspire to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Havens which receive into
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:205168:124"/> their bosome, Vessels weather-bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and torn with Tempests, are much richer ornaments to their Coasts, and fair pieces of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse, then those infamous Rocks, which the Mariners only look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on trembling, and which would want a name did they not cause shipwracks. There is much more pleasure in looking upon the Sun all crowned with the glory of his beams, which brings us joy with light; then to behold a Comet with bloudy locks, which threatens a thousand mischiefs: And if the other superiour Bodies had a will, and acted with reason, it would be certainly, for their favourable As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that Men would praise them, and not for their Malignant Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences.</p>
               <p>The glory which is acquir'd in obliging the Publick, is the only glory which no man quarrels; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every one partakes of it: and the honor of one Man is the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:205168:124"/> of the whole world. Thus Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple touched with so lawfull a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment, have heretofore placed their Benefactors in the number of their Gods, and have adored that valour which was profitable to them. Those who had crusht a Serpent of an extraordinary great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, or slain a Boare which made havock of all about the City, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived religious duties of acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment from their Citizens; and to be a <hi>Heros,</hi> it suffic'd to cleanse the Countrey of some <hi>Monster.</hi> Now I pray you, was there ever a more cruel and more formidable one, then the Tyranny which at this day would swallow up all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Republick, and which is not satisfied, for this hundred and fifty years, or there abouts, since she de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voures States and Kingdomes?</p>

               <p>VVE do not accuse herein the Bloud of <hi>Austria,</hi> nor the particular Actions of any of its <hi>Princes:</hi> They are all extreamly well borne; They all bring into the world great seeds of vertue, which they husband with as great care, Goodnesse, Courage, Wisedome, are the true marks of this Race, and incomparably fairer then the figure of a Sword upon the right Arme, or the impression of a Lance upon the Thigh: There never were more Royall, or more Noble Soules. There cannot be found better, nor sweeter dispositions then theirs: and the Evil which I mean, is of their Fortune, and not of their Person. Besides, that <hi>I</hi> make profession to reverence in generall all higher powers, I know what respect is due to a house whereof the Emperour is but a younger Brother, and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:205168:125"/>
                  <hi>Spaine</hi> one branch. I am not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Sanctity of our Alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances: I see very well from whence our good <hi>Queene</hi> is descended; But I believe she will not take that ill, which the necessity of my discourse exacts from me, and which I am constrained to speak of; the ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a People which now is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to her. she hath not so much passion for the <hi>Kingdome</hi> where she was borne, as for that where she commands; and if it be true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Maximes</hi> of the <hi>Civilians,</hi> that wives are the end of the families from whence they come, and the beginning of those whither they enter; The name which that wise and generous <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse</hi> beares, though most August and Glorious, but yet which cannot passe from her to another, cannot be so dear to her as the hope of that faire posterity which she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to this Crown. The Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests which she hath long since
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:205168:126"/> quited, cannot now divide her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, nor trouble her mind; And that which she hath received from <hi>Spain,</hi> is not, I assure my self, of such consideration with her, as that which she would give to <hi>France.</hi> We seriously honor, and with a particular devotion, those persons which belong unto her: They are doubly sacred, both by their Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter and by their proximity. But truly the design of the Universall <hi>Monarchie,</hi> which was conceived under King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> disclosed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Emperour <hi>Charles,</hi> and which the Counsel of <hi>Spain</hi> hath alwaies nourished ever since that time; cannot be considered with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horror and indignation, by any man that loves his Countrey.</p>
               <p>I intend only to balme that Counsel, of which they are wont to say, Their <hi>Princes</hi> are <hi>Mortall,</hi> but their Counsel is <hi>Eternall:</hi> This Counsel which the <hi>Kings</hi> do find, and not make; which they receive
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:205168:126"/> from Fathers to Son, which they dare no more meddle with then the Foundations of their State, and which exerciseth in some sort a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty distinct from theirs; which they suffer out of a meer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to custome. I blame there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Counsel which followes such dangerous <hi>Maximes,</hi> and not those who have only right intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. I accuse that Counsel which fights against the good nature of the <hi>Prince,</hi> which will command its own Master; and this is the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> whereof I speak.</p>
               <p>See, if you please, with what ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor he throws himself upon the prey; and how he forces himself to teare in pieces the Noblest parts of <hi>Europe. Italie</hi> bleeds in divers places with the scratches which it hath received thence: She is not free from his stroaks but in one lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle corner of firme earth; and all that is sound on that side is so hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy with old age, that it can hardly
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:205168:127"/> move to defend the residue of what is left.</p>
               <p>There remaines nothing entire, nor cognoscible in <hi>Germany,</hi> but the Sea and the Mountaines, because he could not change the face of nature; It is not any more that Province, so free and so powerfull as heretofore: He hath made it groan under the irons and burdens wherewith he hath charg'd it; He hath broken all their priviledges; He hath vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated all their immunities; He hath oppressed them by meer force; They are not any longer his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers which he torments, they are only his wounds. If he flatter some Common-wealth, among the many which he threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, and persecuteth; the good will which he shews them is an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulterate love; He courts it only to enjoy, and makes no offers nor promises, but only to deprive it of its honor, and the power to dispose of it self. His Confederacies are
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:205168:127"/> like those of <hi>Nahash</hi> the <hi>Ammonite,</hi> who answered the men of <hi>Jabesh Gilead,</hi> that desired to enter into Alliance with him; Herein will I consent, if I may pluck out your right eyes, and set you as a reproach before all <hi>Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If his Caresses do not alwaies kill, they weaken and corrupt; If he strangle not with embraces, yet he sullies and spoiles the body which he toucheth. The parts which he leaves no print on with his bitings, he infects with his breath; and though in appearance he seem to spare <hi>Genois,</hi> and those of <hi>Luca,</hi> they cannot say for all this, that he leaves them their Liberty pure and spotlesse, without any stamp of sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very</p>
               <p>To these he gives; from those he borrows; that both may depend upon him: That Pensioners and Debters may keep a Countrey for him, where he hath no Subjects; that he may raign by Family inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:205168:128"/> being not able to do it by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies and Garrisons.</p>
               <p>This golden Fleece so much e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steemed, is a yoke which he impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth upon <hi>petty Princes,</hi> that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not that he tames them by ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring them, and that such a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety gives them a <hi>Master,</hi> and not a <hi>Companion;</hi> He will at last, either destroy all, or possesse all; and as well beyond the <hi>Alps,</hi> as beyond the <hi>Rhine,</hi> he oppresseth all Soveraigns either with his friendship, or his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred.</p>
               <p>There is nothing to be seen about him, but crushed Scepters, broken Crowns, overturned Tribunals, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the torn Ensigns of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Jurisdiction, but the heads of dead <hi>Kings,</hi> and the spoiles of those that are yet alive; There is nothing heard about him, but the plaints and groans of the afflicted, but proud and outragious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, but Bravadoes added to Cruelty, reproaches to the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:205168:128"/> and the voice which ecchoes on all sides, <hi>Woe and Dispaire to the vanquished.</hi>

                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:205168:129"/> the Emperour himself so wise and vertuous, ordinarily bragg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his Familiars, to make the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> the poorest <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> of his <hi>Kingdome:</hi> He embroyl'd them again the very same day they were made friends. The modestest words that he uttered to <hi>Charles</hi> at that time, were, There is no other means to put an end to the publick calamities, but that <hi>Francis,</hi> besides what he is, be <hi>Emperour</hi> and <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> in my place, or I, besides what I am, <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> in his roome.</p>
               <p>He engraved this proud Inscrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the Frontis-piece of a <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> which is to be seen in <hi>Lumbar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; To Philip the second, King of Kings, Spanish, African, Indian, Belgick, the courteous Master of all Nations, chosen by God to re-unite all the separated Empires.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this shall we doubt of his Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Methinks we cannot ask a more express and <hi>authentick Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi>

               <p>He doth not make Warr for the honour of victory, or to recover that which is lost; It is only to get unjustly, and for the hope of booty; He ends not there, to give rest to oppressed <hi>Provinces;</hi> but to disarm his Enemies, and to deceive those whom he could not overcome. And indeed, as soon as he hath with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn his forces, and shut up his Magazins, he makes use of slights, and opens shops full of all wicked and cruell inventions, pernicious and bloody arts.</p>
               <p>There within are kept words of a double meaning, captious promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, oathes which they will violate, false peaces, and Treacherous friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships; all the apples of disorder are gather'd there; There are crafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that labour day and night to

               <p>But think not that he watcheth only for strangers, and that he deals any better with Domesticks: He is not milder at home then abroad, neither is he sociable to any. Is not the whole blood of <hi>Arragon</hi> ruin'd by divers means? Did he not sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice an only son to the suspicions and d strust of his Father? Hath he not very well acknowledged the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and fidelity of <hi>Alexander Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neza, Duke</hi> of <hi>Parma?</hi> Did he not believe he did recompence him, if he used him a little more favourable

Was it not a crime to that poor <hi>Prince</hi> to have done well, and to have bin able to do ill? Whereof was he judg'd guilty, but of his great reputation? Was it not believed he hindered him to grow old, because he feared the progresse of so fair a beginning, because he conceives he had qualities too worthy to command, that they should alwayes be imployed to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey? He protesteth neverthelesse; that he doth nothing but to advance the glory of God, and would have his Cruelties be accounted good, as if he had undertaken them by divine Inspiration, and for the generall good of the world.</p>
               <p>To hear him speak, That if he did not keep Religion here below, she would fly away to heaven; That if he did not uphold the Church, it had fallen long before; and that

                  <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> raigns not, but by the help and assistance he lends him. Yet it is certain, that if Religion were not profitable to him, it would be lesse then indifferent; and that he is the Persecuter of the Church, when she refuseth to be the <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> of his passions, and that he hath alwayes served <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully.</p>

               <p>Dare he deny, but he was the Cause of the Revolt of the <hi>North,</hi> and guilty of <hi>Luthers</hi> first faults?

<pb n="196" facs="tcp:205168:137"/> of them, but he loves them not; If he sends them us, it is in his wrath and in the day of his fury: They are the evils wherewith the prophets threaten us; the effects of his offended providence, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners of his justice. The sword of the Almighty is in the hands of his enemies, <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. It was told of <hi>Esau,</hi> (which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives us for a sign and example of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate) that he should live by his sword. <hi>Woe upon Ashur,</hi> cryeth the Lord by Isaiah: <hi>He is the rod of my fury; He is my staff my indignation is in his hand. Woe unto those that go down into Egypt for aid; The Egyptian is a man and not God, and their horses are flesh and not spirit.</hi> Where we may see by the way, that He not only detests Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, but also the People that are confederate with them, and who adheer unto their Party; He not only condemnes violence, but also base cowardlinesse.</p>

                  <hi>Anti-Christ,</hi> who is called the
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:205168:137"/> Man of Sin, and the Son of Perditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, shall be sent after the same manner as these unjust Conquerers. He shal slay, usurp, and invade, more then ever they have done. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors that are spoken of, are but petty Theeves and ordinary offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in respect of him. He must be enriched with the spoile of the Universe, and gather the succession of all ages: If there be any new <hi>Mines</hi> to be discovered, they are reserved for him. The <hi>Ocean</hi> shall have no pearles, nor amber but for him; All Soveraigns shall be his Subjects, and of all States he shall make but one; It shall be that Beast which Saint John saw ascend out of the sea, who had seven heads and ten hornes, and upon his horns ten Diadems, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy. The Dragon which drew with his taile the third part of the Starrs, and cast them down, shall resign his power to him, and constrain all creatures ot fall down before
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:205168:138"/> him. To him it shall be given to make warr against the Saints, and to overcome them: He shall have power over every Kindred, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Nation. But that Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious men who renounce all hope of <hi>Paradice</hi> for the smallest Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, and sell their soul at too cheap a rate, may draw no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from this comparison, who will flatter their vanity, and boast of the miseries whereof they are the Cause; They must know, that the filthiest and most imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Creatures have heretofore driven people out of their Country, have made Desart, Islands extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fruitfull, and that Frogs, Bats and Locusts have bin imployed; as well as they, to make desolate Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires and to persecute, one while the guilty, another while the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. Even dead things, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate, want not strength, when there is no question but to destroy and ruine. Winds, Rains, Drouths
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:205168:138"/> are more formidable then <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</hi> There needeth but a weeks sicknesse to make of a great King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome a great Wildernesse. One evill Exhalation, which spreads it self from East to West, is able to starve the World by a generall barennesse: And yet <hi>Spinola</hi> with all his skill, and all the forces of his Master, shall have much adoe to make a dearth in a besieged place.</p>
               <p>In the year of <hi>Grace,</hi> 170. a man opening by chance a shrine of gold, which was in the Temple of <hi>Apollo</hi> in <hi>Babylon,</hi> there came out such a pestilent breath, that it choak'd him presently, infected the City and the Province, and over-ran such a vast circuit of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, that almost half Mankind died thereof, and the fairest portion of the Universe was unpeopled. So that the Warr of the <hi>Marcomans</hi> comming in this time, all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was not able to furnish men enough to make up the body of a
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:205168:139"/> full Army, and they were fain to list the Slaves and the <hi>Gladiators,</hi> and other <hi>Criminals,</hi> for want of lawfull Souldiers.</p>
               <p>Under the Reign of the Emperor <hi>Tyberius,</hi> an Earthquake swallowed up 17 Towns of <hi>Asia,</hi> in lesse then 24 houres space, and other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents have destroy'd other famous Cities, which are only now found in Ancient <hi>Geographers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have seen the tops of Steeples in the bottome of waters: I have seen Ships saile over the Cities of <hi>Zeland,</hi> and pittied the greatnesse of humane things, at the sight of this sad and miserable spectacle. And indeed, who is so inchanted with the Court, and so amazed with the noise and Tumult which the fortune of Kings maketh: who doth not contemne the weaknesse of the most mighty, and doth not laugh at the three yeares and a half which were imployed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer a heap of Sand, and to take the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:205168:139"/> place where <hi>Ostend</hi> was, if he will but take the pains to consider, that a hole well stop'd in a bank, may in one night drown'd all the Low-Countreys? To say truth, it is har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to profit then to hurt, to save men then to destroy them: to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the solid, the firme temper of bodies subject to perish, and which may come to an end at every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then to hasten their destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for a few houres.</p>
               <p>And if it be true as Divinity tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us, that the Eternall wisdome in preserving the world continueth in some sort to create; In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the <hi>King,</hi> who hath resolved to underprop shaken States, to re-invest the lawfull <hi>Lords,</hi> and to maintain the ancient Laws, shall do no lesse then Law-givers have done, who first assembled wandring men, who drew the modell of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and laid the Foundations of Policie.</p>

               <p>IF he saw nothing beyond this life, and if he had no Judge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, before whom he must one day appear; He might, as well as others, grow great with the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Christendome; and with time it would not be impossible for him to come to the <hi>Monarchie</hi> of the world: He might make his best of occasions which smile upon him on which side soever he turns him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; to husband the seeds of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion sprung up among our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, hear people that sollicite him, and receive those who would willingly render themselves: Neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary qualities to conquer, and to assure Conquests, are not wanting to him: he is in the strength of a fair and flourishing youth: he hath got an incredible reputation, he hath a boldness astonished at nothing; a patience which performeth all
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:205168:140"/> things, a Kingdome which can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be poor, nor unpeopled.</p>
               <p>I have not resolved here to praise <hi>France,</hi> that rich and pleasant part of the earth, which heaven favours with its sweetest and most amorous aspects, and upon which it sheds the best Influences of the starrs: I will say nothing, in particular, of the reputation of the <hi>King:</hi> It is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently known, by it his Kingdome hath no Frontiers; by it, he reignes in the minds of others Subjects; and that the esteem which strangers make of him, is the cause that they neglect their own <hi>Princes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will speak no more of his bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which hath oftentimes oblig'd him to assault his Enemies, though they were more in number, and had the advantage of the place to fight in; that hath carried him to begin a great warr with his meer Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Guards; which hath made him undertake a businesse which his Father had only discovered, and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:205168:141"/> where his Predecessors having im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed all their might, shew'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but their weaknesse.</p>
               <p>If in the life of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Pavia,</hi> written by his Successor, in the same Dignity there be menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made, as it were, of a half mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, that he durst pass the <hi>Alpes</hi> in the moneth of <hi>March,</hi> to go find at <hi>Lyon,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonians,</hi> in behalf of the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>Goths:</hi> and if the Author call this, to contemne Death, to fight against the violence of the season, and not to fear the injuries of the incensed heaven: What is it that the <hi>King</hi> goes presently to do with an Army? Hath he not conquered in <hi>February</hi> in the precipices, and the Ice? Hath he not taken a Town that the winter, the Mountains, and men defended? For the labour which he built in the Sea, and in the midst of the toss'd waves, I intend not to touch here.</p>
               <p>The modesty of an Orators style
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:205168:141"/> agrees not with an action so strange, so unheard of, so little credible: Poets have only tight to deale on this Subject, it belongs to their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall language, and as they call it, <hi>Heroick;</hi> it is worthy of their <hi>Enthusiasme,</hi> and of their pompous and figurative descriptions; It would be to enter into their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, and to pass those bounds which do divide us, but to be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to relate the Captivity of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> the restrain'd power of the waves, the removed place of the Elements, the Empire of winds, and of fortune which hath changed its <hi>Master,</hi> and no longer acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth any but <hi>Lewis the Just.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did Truth more resemble a lye then this; and we doubt yet whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were a dream, or an Inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or a story.</p>
               <p>So much there is that we may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vow, that the <hi>King</hi> is bold, even to undertake things without example, which ravish with admiration those
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:205168:142"/> that behold them, and appear to others so hard and difficult, that they have much ado not to account them Fabulous; But we must avow by the same means, that his boldness never did any thing without his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,</hi> and that this which is not contrary to Readinesse, of which we will presently speak, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compenced his paines, crowned his work, set the affaires in their last perfection, and hath founded an Eternall peace upon an intire victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
               <p>We might have seen else-where great beginnings, formidable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, many warrs proclaimed, store of Edicts of fire and blood: But these beginnings had bin but recal'd by other contrary ones, and these warres had bin ended by a lost expenses; these Preparations had done no more hurt, then the machiness of a Theater, then the picture of Dragons and Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>russes, these Edicts had been
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:205168:142"/> dishonourable accommodation: The first success that had not answered our wish, had made us curse the whole business; At the least diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie which had offered it self con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to our expectation, we had fallen out with <hi>Paris,</hi> regretted the Court, and the <hi>Tuilleries;</hi> A good and wholsome Counsell had bin blamed, not for having bin followed with a bad event, but for not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving produced an effect soon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough: And if the Victory had not come just at the point that we would have had, we had left our affaires thus far advanced, and grown desperate at a thing half done. Patience then is absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary to execute high and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant enterprises; to go on just right to the mark, without staying on one or other side of the way; to doe that which he hath resolved, to make a mock of running reports, to prefer durable glory and solid ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, before a short reputation, and
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:205168:143"/> the vanity of appearance; To be moved neither at the murmures of his own, not the bravadoes of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, to come to the end of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinate resolution, after he hath spent its strength to overcome. Lastly, that which both will, and and knows how to defend it self. But what need we dissemble? This vertue which the King this day puts in use, is as new to us, as it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to our Fathers; the publick voice reproacheth us with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary vice, and all Antiquity hath blamed us for it: For though some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they swore solemnly never to put of their belts till they had won the Capitol, and sometimes promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed their God to consecrate to him the Armes of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and to present him a Collar of Gold made of their bootie; Though yet living under Christian Laws, they obliged themselves to take Cities, and vow'd never to put off their Cloathes, nor to eat nor drink till
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:205168:143"/> they had gained them, which they called to swear and vow a Siege, yet most commonly they broke their vow, and violated their oath; and if at any time they gained the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which they besieg'd, it was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by rashnesse then by reason, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in losing men, then in managing the time; and more for that the Art of Fortification was unknown, then that they knew how to assault them.</p>
               <p>For my own part, I cannot praise this casuall and disorderly valour; It is no hard matter to be couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for a time, but alwayes to be, is hard; and an even temper hath bin so much esteemed amongst some <hi>Sages,</hi> that they have believed, that it was something more excellent to persevere in an Evill, then not to be assur'd in vertue.</p>
               <p>There is a great company of men who would do good actions, if they should endure for but a day; there are few that are able to manage a
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:205168:144"/> long design; There are few so eager, whose motion passeth not away, or who have continuall furies; There are scarce any but had rather under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take many businesses, and change often, then to fix to one object, and continue in the same labour. The most part of the Northern people do thus, and have only some rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and suddain motions; They use no discourse, nor make use of reason to a warr, but collecting all their vigour together, and casting out all their choller; at first, they make an extream fierce onset; after which, finding more resistance then they expected, and the property of violence being to indure but a while, if reason and argument be not there to maintain it, as they were more then men at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, so they become lesse then wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the pursuit of their action and as if they went out of a fitt of a fever, after they have bin stirr'd, they languish in a lethargie; they
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:205168:144"/> flie ordinarily, if they put not to flight, and yield themselves, if they do not take: At least they will hazard their fortune and their hopes all at once, and aske a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall assault, or one set battell, that they may have nothing to do to morrow: They never dreame of overcoming, but of ending the warre, and to go out of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent inconveniences even by thier defeat, nay by their death: That brave <hi>Gaule</hi> knew it very well in the Commentaries of his Enemy, where answering the objections of his Accusers; he protested he would not leave the charge of his Army with any body, for fear lest he, to whom he left it, press'd with the importunity of the multitude, might be constrain'd to fight; to which he saw all were inclin'd, for that they had not courage, nor were able to endure the tediousnesse of a Warr. And in another pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of the same writings, we may
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:205168:145"/> see that it is oftentimes cowardice and not boldnesse, to remit all to the decision of one Battle; and that more are found who will willingly offer themselves to death, then who will manfully suffer pain.</p>
               <p>The Emperor <hi>Otho</hi> was conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, because he had not patience to conquer: He kil'd himself out of daintinesse, and chose rather to perish quickly, then to suffer but a while: without shewing any fear, or being put to slight, he was the deserter of his Party, and the fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his own Army: He wanted neither Counsell nor strength; he had the fairest Troops, and the most desirous to do well that ever were seen; and yet by reason of one day which was not fortunate to them, he abandoned the victory to an enemy who in all things was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to him, and quitted his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty because he got not at the first blow. He renounced the Empire, his honour and his life, for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:205168:145"/> able to support the doubt and uncertainty of the future; and the care of being still sollicitous after his affairs, seemed so troublesome to him, that in some sort to be at leisure, he went out of the world.</p>
               <p>We see by this, that weaknesse, as well as necessity, carryes men to desire extreams, and that not only the valiant and the desperate despise death, but also the nice and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented.</p>
               <p>The opinion of misery toucheth weak minds more violently then misery it self; they believe they do very much to save themselves from being toss'd, to fall down, and preferr an ill condition before an uncertain one: It is impossible for them to let events succeed, and to expect the maturity of things: They would hasten the course of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and advance its effects; they would manage at their pleasure its motions and periods: They would
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:205168:146"/> lead it, and not follow it, as if it were Their providence, and not Gods.</p>
               <p>Wise men do otherwise, <hi>David</hi> gives this testimony of himself; That he hath patiently waited for the Lord, who deceived him not: And yet this impatience is so naturall to a man, and so hard to be overcome, that he confesseth, that the successes which he hoped for, have often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wearied his hopes; that his spirit was dismayed in the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of what was to come, and his faith weakned by the length of time which came not; that many times murmurings slipt from him, even to doubt of his Anointing, and of the word of <hi>Samuel,</hi> saying, <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man is a lyar;</hi> to say to God himself: <hi>Sleepest thou O Lord?</hi> Hast thou forgot thy Promise? Wilt thou falsifie thy Oath? Now, since a Prince who was assured of Gods design, by express Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and by an infallible knowledg,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:205168:146"/> seeing that the effects of promises went on more slowly then he desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, was disquieted to hope, and had doubts, and beginnings of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiency: What praises shall we bestow upon the <hi>King?</hi> Who not knowing whether his enterprises should be successfull or no, but knowing only that they were just: not knowing whether God would reward them in this world, but knowing only that he doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove them; brings an invincible firmness and perseverance: from which he can be turned neither by the length of time, nor by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of expence, nor by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of adversaries, who increase; nor by the default of Friends, who faile; nor by the hardnesse of the matter which he encounters; nor by the repugnancy of the workmen which he imployes?</p>

               <p>NOthing is impossible to a <hi>Prince</hi> which knowes how to expect and persevere thus; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he is young, and hath not only before him a large time to imploy, but can also change his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue according to the diversity of oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, and make use of expedition, where patience is not beneficiall.</p>
               <p>The Age whereof the <hi>King</hi> is now, is the age of well-undertaking, and of well-acting, the fulness and perfection of a man, the vigor and solidity of life: Children are not yet come to it, and old men are pass't it; one are the Flowers, the other the bark: These know not the things of the world, the others have forgotten them.</p>
               <p>Men grow not old impunely and without some notable diminution of themselves: It costs ordinarily all a mans strength, and a piece of his
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:205168:147"/> reason: A man cannot be twice, &amp; we do wrong to call that ripe, which is rotten; and to believe that good counsels can only proceed from the want of naturall heat: This would be to give a very dishonourable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to Prudence, to make it the daughter of Infirmity: It would be, to be ungratefull to God, to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to time and other inferiour Causes, the grace which we hold only from him.</p>
               <p>Thus the most ancient and best instructed <hi>Philosophers,</hi> having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it as a generall Belief, that good sence is the possession of the Ancient, and that the multitude of years teacheth wisdome: He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes that he had bin of that opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but that since he had known, That the Ancient do not alwayes understand judgment, and that old men are not alwayes wise: That it is the Inspiration of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty which giveth understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and that the spirit is from
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:205168:148"/> man, and not from age.</p>
               <p>And a <hi>Rabbin,</hi> who is of no small authority among the <hi>Jews,</hi> expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that Text of holy Scripture, <hi>Your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;</hi> concludes from these words; That yong men are admitted neerer God then old men, and that they have a more particular communication of his secrets; Forasmuch as the knowledg which is drawn from a vision, is clearer and more distinct, then that which proceeds from a dream.</p>
               <p>If we may believe those who have the honour to be neer the <hi>King,</hi> and to consider the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward course of his life, the source of his actions; he is so happie in what he conceiveth, and judgeth so cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly of uncertain things, that it appears he beholds them not after our manner, and that he is guided by a purer light then that of ordinary reason; The most part of
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:205168:148"/> the great resolutions which he hath taken, have bin sent him from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; The greatest part of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels come from a superiour Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and are rather to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the immediate Inspirations of God, then proposals made by men. He oftentimes finds truth without taking the pains to search for it; and the suddenest motion of his thought, is ordinarily so rationall and so concluding, that the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discourse doth only approve that first act, without adding any new thing thereto.</p>
               <p>I know there is a miserable sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which men learn by their faults and their misfortunes; and that many become Physitians from the strength and frequency of their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases. But yet this advantage of long age, which is got only by the losse of the dearest and most pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious part of our life, is not wanting to the <hi>Kings</hi> youth; and fortune hath assembled so many divers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,

               <p>There have passed some whole seasons, wherein the world seemed to be a sleep, and that there was, as it were, a generall suspension of all the functions of an active life; There is a <hi>vacuum,</hi> an emptie space in the memorie of things: Renown gives but a very slender testimony thereof: Books tell us no news; there is not any History of that time, or at most it is only imployed
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:205168:149"/> in describing the Feasts and Masks at the <hi>Carnevall,</hi> in representing the order of a Ceremony, and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of a <hi>Turney,</hi> in relating the Arrivall of some <hi>King</hi> to his Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall City, or the Solemnities of his Marriage. We are not borne in such soft and idle seasons: the Reign of the <hi>King</hi> is not of this sort. It is remarkable as well by its proper storms, as by the changes and revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions which have hapned in all <hi>Europe:</hi> There hath bin nothing but tumults and hurli-burly, but Civil and domestick divisions, but revolts or intendments to them; They never disarmed for good and all, nor was there any concord or agreement which was not broken the next day: The publick good, and the reformation of the State, have almost ruined the Publick and the State three or foure times: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie hath bin assaulted on all sides, and by all kind of engines and plots. He hath bin fain to avenge it of the
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:205168:150"/> outrages of those that contemned it, to draw it out of their hands that abus'd it; He hath been compel'd to punish his Lovers, and his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to defend himself from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in against evill Counsellors, and from without against Rebels; to purchase the Covetous, to honor the Ambitious, and at last to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer both the one and the other. The <hi>King</hi> hath bin nourished in this fair Calme, he hath grown up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midst these oppositions and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions.</p>
               <p>This was the pastime of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, and the recreations he was allowed, after the death of the late <hi>King</hi> his Father: These are the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers which he found in the way he made; the shades and resting places which were erected for him in his passage: Yet to say the truth, so harsh and rigid an exercise hath not bin unprofitable to him. The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pest hath taught him the art of swimming; Adversity hath read
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:205168:150"/> him lessons which he wil make use of all his life; He hath not lost his time in so sad a School: Pains af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford more instructions then plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures; It is much better for him that Adversaries have exercised his vertue, then that Flatterers had corrupted it: He hath drawn much more profit from his great variety of misfortunes, then he could have had contentment from so long a peace, whose daies are all alike. At least, in a good houre he hath learned hence to be secret, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had at first to encounter a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Traitors and Spies, and to guard himself from all the cunning of an evill time; He hath acquir'd the perfection of that quality, which makes man the true possessor of himself, and whereby he is not put in the power of another, by an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderate liberty; that he retains a setled mind in the ambushments and enterprises of wicked men: That he spends by measure and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:205168:151"/> with discretion, and leaves no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward mark of his Intentions to those that should not know them: He hath practised before their sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and in the Innocence of his first years, the other vertues of old age; and at the age where we begin to observe onely good inclinations, we have admired perfect Habits.</p>
               <p>We have seen a wise Child, a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Child, a Child equally instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the affaires of peace and of warr. We have seen a Child jealous of his Authority, a Child the Rivall and Emulator of the glory of a great <hi>King</hi> his Father, a Child him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the Father of his Countrey. We have seen Conspiracies extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Tyrants rooted out, Cities for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, Armies broken by a Child. What shall I say more? He hath done very opportunely, all that he ought to do to conquer; and if we change the Theater of his actions, he would have conquered the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which he hath preserved. He
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:205168:151"/> hath bin victorious in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and will be the same else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where when it shall please him: He can find nothing difficult, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving subjected the <hi>French</hi> to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</p>
               <p>And certainly, when he shall be seen in the head of his Armies, that he ranks his Souldiers himself, that he appoints their Quarter, that he causeth the Carriages to come, that he may see what places are conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to take, or to be quitted; when it shall be he that gives all the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, who makes the principall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, who takes notice of the least functions of every charge, things must needs turn out of their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary course, nor go the way they ought, if he thrived no better then the <hi>Princes</hi> who reigned at their ease in the bosome of a Wife, or of a Mistress, and who beholding their affaires no where, but in the dispat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of their Lievetenants, expecting
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:205168:152"/> ordinarily the success 300 Leagues from the warr.</p>

               <p>YEt all this need not cause fear in any one, this throng of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues will oppress no body; he hath a Conscience so tender, that it can suffer no weight upon it, nor any thing that recedes never so little from perfect equity: It must first be satisfied before he can content his courage, and must first approve the design which he hath, before he forme his resolution.</p>
               <p>He sayes not to the <hi>Casuists,</hi> find reasons wherefore I may go aside, and perswade me that I am inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, though I find my self guilty. The rest and quiet of his soul is not established by such easie means, not depends upon the subtilty of a Doctor. He is the Judge of others works, but the Tyrant (if I may so say) of his own, and never does
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:205168:152"/> himself that favour, which others may sometimes receive from him.</p>
               <p>In the most advantagious busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness which can be proposed to him, if he were assured of the prosperity of the success, and were not certain of the goodness of the Cause, he would stop upon this difficulty, and couragiously refuse Scepters and Crowns if they were presented to him; I do not say with a mortall sin which he were oblig'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, but with one doubtfull action, and which had need of an exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, lest he might faile in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</p>
               <p>He fears not the oppositions of <hi>Princes,</hi> the Confederacies of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicks,</hi> the Forces of many <hi>Kings</hi> assembled together against the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of his Armes. He fears not the injuries of the season, the difficulty of the places, a multitude of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent dangers which threaten his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at the warr; But truly he fears God: And were there as many
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:205168:153"/> worlds indeed, as some <hi>Phîlosophers</hi> have built in their fancy, to have them all, he would not offend him once.</p>
               <p>This Fear hath nothing of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardice and softnesse; It may fall upon the spirit of a man perfectly couragious, it is not contrary to true valour, it is not faintnesse of heart, but strength of judgment: It is not a passion, but a vertue; of which the Fathers have spoken, when they say, that in the soul of a Christian fear must be the Guardian of Innocence; and the Apostle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, when he exhorts the <hi>Philippians</hi> to be carefull for their salvation with fear and trembling: With this Fear the Holy <hi>Patriarchs</hi> were seised; those hardy and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous men, who wrestled with Angels, who knew that they should be the Ancestors of the Saviour of the World: Who were the friends, the Entertainers, the Familiars of God: And yet the privity which
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:205168:153"/> they had with him, took not away their fear, nor this neer acquaintance hinder them from being afraid of his Supream Justice.</p>
               <p>I have oftentimes admired in the Books of <hi>Moses</hi> those strange manner of speeches: The God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> The God of <hi>Isaac,</hi> and the <hi>Feare</hi> of <hi>Jacob.</hi> And <hi>Jacob</hi> sware by the <hi>Feare</hi> of <hi>Isaac</hi> his Father, that is to say, by the God of his Father.</p>
               <p>The very place where God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to one of them, hath the name <hi>Fearfull,</hi> of a truth the <hi>Lord</hi> is in this place: He was afraid, and cryed, this place is <hi>Fearfull;</hi> and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, He that is terrible, who taketh away the heart of <hi>Princes,</hi> and is <hi>Fearfull</hi> to the <hi>Kings</hi> of the Earth; this in one word is God: And St. <hi>Paul</hi> saith of <hi>Moses,</hi> that he was afraid and trembled, so ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible was that which appeared unto him. So that it is spoken of <hi>Feare</hi> almost every where, where it is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:205168:154"/> of Divinity: And these admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Personages</hi> who presented themselves with an assured Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the fury of the incensed people, who brav'd the anger of <hi>Kings,</hi> and despis'd the power of Devils, had so great an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of displeasing God, that God is simply called their <hi>Feare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>King</hi> is fearfull, he hath the fear of wise and valiant men; he trembleth in the presence of the Lord: His Maximes never offend the duties of Charity, his Politique Prudence is not contrary to the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Christians; he hath seated Integrity in the Throne, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that he is the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his Subjects in the service of their great <hi>Master;</hi> and that the Care of his Salvation is his most important business; he perceives that by right of a Servant the most obliged ought to be the most faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and that it would be a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advantage for him to be able to
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:205168:154"/> sin with Authority; to obey nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Lawes nor Reason, to make his Independance appear, to fill Annals and Histories with his Conquests, and to be blotted out of the Book of Life.</p>

               <p>I Cannot conceale in this place my just grief; it is very importunate to cry without ceasing against the Times and the manners: I am troubled to meet in my way, <hi>Vice,</hi> the Enemy of that vertue which I seek for, and not to be able to praise the <hi>King</hi> without blaming others.</p>
               <p>But what way is there to speak of <hi>Hercules,</hi> if there be no mention of <hi>Monsters?</hi> To consider a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror without Enemies?

The wise, if they are Subjects, betray their <hi>Prince</hi> and sell the State; The valiant assault his Person, and put themselves in his place.

Warr is neither ended by Treaty nor Victory: They keep their word no longer then they have the first occasion to break it; nor are ever quiet, but when they are not able to stirr. Lastly, these rare qualities which the world admires, resemble those glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious lights which sparkle in the aire, and shed forth a pestilence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth. These vertues are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and dangerous to the Common-wealth, or rather they are not ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues at all: And without doubt we must rest satisfied with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Oracle of Truth: That wisdome entreth not into a malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous soul: And elsewhere it is said, <hi>That the Children of this generation are wiser then the Children of light;</hi> And we read in the Gospel of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> that the wicked Steward did many things prudently. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, seeing it is most certain that humane wisdome is foolishnesse
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:205168:156"/> with God, and there is no more Prudence without his fear, then there can be a building without a foundation. We must believe that in these passages our Lord speaks tenderly with his Children, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodates himself to vulgar lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. For as sometimes we call those white who are pale, and take fulnesse of body for healthfulnesse; so many times we give certain vices the names of vertues which are neer unto them.</p>

<pb n="237" facs="tcp:205168:157"/> who seeth signs and won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders before they happen, and the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of times and ages: She is a raye from God, and a pure influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the brightness of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; and therefore can have no filth in her; and a little Tower: She is the splendor of the everlasting light, the Image of the goodness of God, the spotless glass of his <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie;</hi> and in another place it is said: The fear of the Lord is wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to depart from evill is understanding: And again, The Soul of the holy man declareth Truth, and seeth more then se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Watchmen set upon a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Pagans</hi> generally were not of a contrary opinion, though they were not enlightned by faith, and walked only in the night; they have found the truth sometimes by Torch-light. Amongst them, those that had the rightest opinions, and pass'd the soundest judgment upon
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:205168:158"/> things, never divided Prudence from honesty; and though they believed that the extent of reason was more free, and less confin'd in the Politicks then in Morality; yet they conceived not, that That space must be infinite, and that whatever is evill and forbidden in Families, is good and lawfull in the <hi>State;</hi> They have said, that the Gods had much more obliged men, in not gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them this Reason, then to have bestowed it upon them to be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciall to the world, and to tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themselves: That this beam of Divinity, this quick motion of the thought, this point which pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth and penetrateth all things, were but a sad present to them, and a pernicious liberality; if they should make use of it only to the dammage and loss of another, and if what they have common with the gods, render'd them more savage and more miserable then the beasts. They have believed as well as us,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:205168:158"/> that Loyalty is the foundation of all business and commerce, that by it we hold together one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that those that are divided by the distance of place, by the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of language, by the diversity of Religion, are united by the means of good faith and upright dealing: That a man may deale with dumb men, but not with perfidious; and silence is more sociable then lying: They have held, that a man gain'd nothing by telling a lye, but not to be believed when he speaks truth, leaving us this consequence; that we must be honest men of necessity and out of Interest, when we cannot be by Inclination nor will; since evill is as unprofitable as dishonest, and the first cheate ordinarily excludes the second; and confidence once lost, it is not possible to hurt or profit any body.</p>
               <p>In the Ancient Fables which were presented, by authority of the Magistrate, for the instruction of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:205168:159"/> the people, and which yet are the true mirrors of humane life, we see that the <hi>Hero's</hi> and <hi>Princes</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test aloud, that they hate dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling more then death, and that there is no way whereby they be resolved to deceive, even where Varlets are, and people of no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, who are imployed to plot Treasons, and make windings and labyrinths; and though in such like actions there wants wit and subtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: yet because deceit is a tacite confession of weakness, which doth that in secret, which it dares not do openly; they suppose it was not convenient to attribute it to great courages. So that <hi>Titus Livius</hi> is sharply reprehended by <hi>Seneca,</hi> for saying of one of the Troublers of his Age, that he had a spirit no lesse great then wicked: It being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible in the judgement of that Philosopher, that these two quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties should subsist in one and the same subject; great and evill seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Not that it was forbidden <hi>Tragick Poets</hi> to make evill Maximes proceed from wicked men, when they brought them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Stage; but because <hi>Hyppolitus</hi> was known for a perfect vertuous man, they thought that <hi>Euripides</hi> would authorize a lye by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of so grave a person, and so much esteemed; and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade the spectators, in letting this vice run among many lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble qualities, that unfaithfulness

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asmuch as This bears it self indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently towards good and evill: Whereas Prudence is constant and unchangeable in the search of good; and that he hath made one expresse chapter in the 7 Book of his <hi>Ethicks;</hi> wherein he proveth, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to be Prudent and Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent both together. He observeth moreover in another place, that in taking assunder the compound word, whereby the <hi>Greeks</hi> expresse <hi>Temperance,</hi> we shall find the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive word to signifie the Guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Preserver of <hi>Prudence:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Temperance</hi> preserveth the soundnesse of Judgement, and procures it that galliard and lively disposition, by which, without trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling or disquieting it self, it knows what is serviceable and what is hurtful to the soveraign good: Not that Intemperance corrupteth all kind of Judgement; for it is most certain, that it corrupteth not those
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:205168:161"/> things which lie in speculation, but only those which have practise for their object. As to be Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, makes not a man unable to judge whether it be true or no, that a Triangle hath three Angls equall to two streight ones, and that two Parallel lines, continued in Infini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, cannot be joyned together; But it makes him unable to judge, whether he ought to revenge an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, or pardon it, Whether he should keep <hi>Helen,</hi> or restore her to her Husband; because to judge well whether a thing be feasible or no, it is necessary to know the end. Now he that is Intemperate, whose judicative facultie, grief or pleasure hath corrupted, cannot discerne that end, amidst the continuall dazling which his evill passions cause in him.</p>
               <p>True Prudence then is a Habite, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> renders the understanding apt know, and practise those things to which serve to make a man happie:
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:205168:161"/> Which (as the same Philosopher goes on) that other Habite, which we call Art, doth not effect; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause its Function consisteth in working conformably to the Rules and Ordinances of Reason, and in doing things which are Morally good, and contribute to felicity: So that a Man may be a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist, and yet not an honest Man; But a Man cannot be a Prudent Man, but withall he must be an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Man; Because a Man cannot be Prudent unlesse he practise those things that are Morally good. Moreover it is better to fail volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily in an Art, then to fail igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly: And contrarily, it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to fail ignorantly against the Rules of Prudence, then voluntarily; seeing those things are not Morally good, to which Art is fixed, as those are, to which Prudence is; and therefore a Man cannot err wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly against the Rules which it prescribes, but he must commit some
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:205168:162"/> vicious action; because the failing lies in this, that he joynes himself to those things which are Morally evill.</p>
               <p>These and such like <hi>Maximes</hi> are found in the Books of Philosophers, who have bin most frequent in the Court, and have had the neerest ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to Great men: The other Families have not held a contrary opinion, nor hath any one of them approved a malicious Prudence: But those latter <hi>Platonicks,</hi> that are of those Fools who sometimes are in their right wits, and who have some rationall intervals, deserve to be heard in this businesse: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed against such a publick evill as this, we must arme all sorts Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and oppose against it what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever can fight and combate it.</p>
               <p>Having made something a long digression upon divers sorts of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, (which for this once I will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem an effect of Heroicall Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) at last they propose one
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:205168:162"/> which is not to be rejected, and which makes greatly to our present subject. There are, as they reckon, besides Death, five kinds of Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by which the Soul is divided from the Body; and is lifted so far above mortall and perishable; that in this condition she knows not only that which is farr off, but also that which never yet happened; It assists not only to the birth and events of things, but to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Conception. The first of these Separations happens in sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, chiefly in sober men, who by an ordinary abstinence do abate those clouds, as it were, which rise from the inferiour part, hindering any trouble or contagion to arise to the spirit; and beholding in their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, as in a most transparent Glasse, the objects which others cannot discover in theirs, which is all sullied and defaced with the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors and steam of meats. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, consists in an entire benum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mednesse
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:205168:163"/> of the spirits, and by that failing of the heart and breath, whereby people fall in a swoon: From whence proceeded those Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasies of <hi>Socrates,</hi> who remain'd sometimes from Sun-rising to Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, without moving at all; And those of <hi>Plato,</hi> who using to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in this sort, dyed at last in that essay of Death; And those of one <hi>Enarchus,</hi> who having delivered up the ghost, as was believed, came to himself again, and assur'd them that he was well, but that <hi>Nichandus,</hi> the most famous Champion of that time, should certainly die such a day, which came accordingly to passe.</p>
               <p>So pure and subtile a knowledge is formed from the superabundance of the melancholick humour, which is as proper to receive Divine Inspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and to be overspread with celestiall fire, as dry and thin matters are more combustible then others: But it proceeds most perfectly, say
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:205168:163"/> they, from the just proportion of humors, and from that admirable internall harmony, in which the Spirit, like the Magistrate in a well uinted Corporation where all the people are at agreement, finds no obstacle in his offices, and uses with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reservation or restriction, the power which he hath received from his Soveraign.</p>
               <p>The third <hi>Separation,</hi> if I mistake not, comes from the repose and peace of solitariness, where the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit escaped from the Captivity of Cities, and discharged of the weighty and troublesome employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life, beholds heaven more uncovered, and communicates more familiarly with God.</p>
               <p>They believe that in this peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble School <hi>Zoroaster</hi> studied those 20 years in which he appear'd not, and learnt the Science of foretelling, which he left in his Books of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which are lost; and thus we are to understand the 10 years
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:205168:164"/> that <hi>Pythagoras</hi> was conceal'd, and those 50 which <hi>Epimenides</hi> slept, during which time their soul, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no commerce with their sense, was vacant to a most perfect man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Philosophying, and already injoy'd the priviledge of Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and the liberties of another life.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Platonicks</hi> do not end their <hi>Separations</hi> here, but from this they passe to a fourth, which proceedeth from admiration, and a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious horrour which filleth persons agitated with some Divinity, such as were the women whom they cal'd <hi>Pythiae,</hi> who drew out the knowledge of future things: For transported as they were with their God coming to enter into their Grot, and thinking with a violent attention upon his presence and his mysteries; they were seised with so great an astonishment, and posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with so strange a superstition, that presently their soul forsaking
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:205168:164"/> their body, and breaking all its chains, was carryed to the highest knowledge of simple Spirits, and acted supernaturally by the strength of that divine fever.</p>
               <p>Here our <hi>Platonicks</hi> leave off to dream, and their last manner of knowing future things is altogether for us; to wit, an intire victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver evill passions; a perpetuall ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinence from forbidden pleasures, an inviolable chastity of Soul and Body, it being very credible, in their opinion; That God, who is purity it self, takes pleasure to make his abode in the heart of the Chast; that he sets up a light there which penetrateth the darknesse of future things, and that he hides from them none of his enterprises. To which also the Holy Fathers seem to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and particularly St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> who holds that the <hi>Sybils,</hi> though otherwise Infidels, and strangers to the people of God, received never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless from him the gift of <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi>
                  <pb n="252" facs="tcp:205168:165"/> in honour of their Virginity, and for a Temporall reward of their vertues.</p>
               <p>I will not serve my turn with these opinions which I believe not, nor attribute the <hi>Prudence</hi> of the <hi>King,</hi> either to his sobriety, it being most true, that he lives, as it were, only of spirit, and that by the means of Temperance the superior part of his soul enjoys a perpetuall serenity; or to his removals from the City, whereof <hi>Hunting</hi> is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the pretence, in which, with a calme sight, and an uninteressed Judgment, he considers things in the purity of their being, which we behold but obliquely through our passions which trouble us, and in the infection of the world which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth them.</p>
               <p>I will no more attribute them to this quality so proper to contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and which fixeth it self inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably to the objects which it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth; to that Temperature so
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:205168:165"/> esteemed of by the <hi>Philosophers,</hi> which communicates nothing of weight, which can incline them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the earth. For in effect, as there is an earthly melancholy which sends up none but black and thick vapours to the brain, and fils it with nothing but phantasmes, which bury the Soul in the matter; which causeth either continuall dreams, or often stupidity; so there is a well digested and refined me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, which casts forth a fire which neither burns nor smoaks; to which may be applyed that saying of the Ancient, That dry light is most lively and full of lustre. There is a subtile and ingenuous sadness, which hath bin even at Heaven to search for Truth, and at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the deep: which inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Arts and Sciences, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med all the <hi>Statuas</hi> of <hi>Phidias,</hi> and brought forth all the Books of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle;</hi> which carried <hi>Caesar</hi> to usurp the Liberty of his Countrey, and
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:205168:166"/>
                  <hi>Brutus</hi> to deliver his Countrey from the power of <hi>Caesar;</hi> which, in a word, is the faire maladie of the soul, and the most common temper of <hi>Hero's, Saints,</hi> and other extraordinary men.</p>
               <p>It is not therefore from thence, that I deduce the prudence of the <hi>King;</hi> I make it come from a more noble and clearer spring: I believe with the Christian <hi>Philosophers,</hi> that alwayes God hath had a most speciall care to enlighten the Chast and vertuous, and that the Spouse is not more pleas'd among the Lillies, then the Eternall wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that governs her, is pleas'd willingly to repose himself upon pure and innocent Souls: All other wisdome which comes elsewhere, is illegitimate and dangerous; all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fires, though never so pure and sparkling, deceive men in enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, and lead them into ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, or into precipices.</p>
               <p>It were almost as good consult
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:205168:166"/> the Devils, and enquire after what's to come by Magick, as to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science without honesty. Is it not to turn medicines into poysons, to use Reason to sin? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose is it to be subtle to invent He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies which are worse then igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? What serves it for to be able to make a hurly-burly, if a man must first lose his own rest to disquiet anothers? To what purpose is it to have the cunning of <hi>Lodowick Sfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za,</hi> and to be dextrous to ruine his State, which an ordinary Spirit had bin able to preserve by easie and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall rules?</p>
               <p>They shall never perswade me, that Quick-silver is better then Gold; nor that a turbulent and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted Imagination, can be a surer guide to manage businesses, then a calme and well-resolved Judgment; nor that the Prudence of <hi>Tyberius</hi> was better then that of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Just:</hi> The one was busied in assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himself of that <hi>Old man</hi> whom
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:205168:167"/> he alwayes feared; It abandoned the care of affaires, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the <hi>Empire,</hi> to be at leisure to observe only one man; It ravished <hi>Germanicus</hi> from the whole earth: It caused a stranger <hi>Prince</hi> to be put to death, who came to <hi>Rome</hi> upon the Publick Faith. The other hath for its object the Universall good, and the Common felicity, nor is imployed but to maintain the things of the world in a good state, and to make Justice raign; It desires no other advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from its victories, but what procures reputation abroad, and a good conscience at home.</p>

               <p>I wonder not, that the <hi>Princes</hi> who will not acknowledg the God-head of Christ, do estrange themselves from his example, and are not sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a Law which they have not received. The <hi>Mahometans</hi> think
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:205168:169"/> they merit when they kill strangers, and their Cruelty is one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of their Religion: They make no scruple to conquer, because there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they do nothing but what their Prophet exhorted them to; and it is to Persecutors, and not to Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs that he promiseth a better life after this.</p>
               <p>This Cheater, who provided for nothing in his Religion but tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Greatnesse and a present good, and who dreamt rather of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shall Souldiering, then of saving souls, banisheth from his Paradise all peaceable persons, and names those Cowards whom our Lord calls Just. Let no man, saith he, turne his back, unlesse it be to take advantage, upon pain of incurring divine indignation: For it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite that the brave Champions of God and of his Prophet remaine firme at the encounter of two Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and in so doing they shall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a generall pardon for all their their faults.</p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:205168:169"/>
               <p>In another place, he saith, Are you of opinion that the entrance of Heaven shall be open to you, if first you give not good proof that you are Magnaminous and Valiant Warriors? No, my Friends, assure your selves, God loves none but the Valiant; That he is truly happie who dies in the Warr; and if you finish your dayes there, your death shall be worthily rewarded; if you shall be willing to live again, that you may once more be slain: And a little before, he Authorizeth his Tyranny by the expresse command of God, whom he brings in speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus: And Thou my Prophet; Go fight, and overcome the Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, Pillage them, Sack them, handle them with rods of Iron, that they may fear; for all is the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and his faithfull Souldiers.</p>
               <p>So that, by this meanes, imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world is their Inheritance, and that the whole possession thereof belongs to them; they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:205168:170"/> they never usurp over another, but recover only that which hath bin usurped from them; That they do no injurie to any body, but cease only to receive one; that it is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to them to re-enter upon their goods by those meanes that seem shortest and most convenient for them; That there is nothing more lawfull for them, then what God himself hath adjudged, and that they may use that right which their Law-Giver hath left them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all the Kingdomes of the Earth. For it is one of their visions, that as he came out of his Mothers wombe, An Angel brought him three keyes made of three great Pearls, whereof one was the key of Lawes, another the key of Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and the third that of Victory; Which he seizing upon, seiz'd also the possession of all these things But to speak truth, the last gave power to the two first, and if he had not overcome, he had neither
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:205168:170"/> bin believed, nor followed.</p>
               <p>The whole design of his Religion relates to Victories, his Prophecies are only favourable to Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; The most part of his Laws are militarie Ordinances; he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth none for his, but the violent and unjust: And that he may drive them more strongly to the desolation of Kingdomes, it was not enough for this Impostor to declare unto them, that they might conquer with a safe Conscience; but he brands them with a kind of Infamy, when they content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with their own Line in peace: From whence it comes to passe, that it is not permitted to the <hi>Ottoman Princes</hi> to found an Hos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitall nor to make a <hi>Mosque,</hi> if first they have not gained a Conquest, to which it is necessary that themselves were present. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it is that the <hi>Mufty,</hi> and the other inferiour Interpreters of their prophane Ceremonies, used all their
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:205168:171"/> Credit towards the <hi>Sultan Acme▪</hi> who never had bin at the Warr to hinder the structure of the Temple which he was building, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was surnamed by the Lawyers, The <hi>Incredulous Mosque,</hi> because he was so obstinate as to finish it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the authority of their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the Remonstrances which they made to him.</p>
               <p>I find it not strange that the <hi>Turks</hi> do invade the Lands of their Neighbours, upon this false perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which they have to do Acts of Piety, and to find themselves obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged according to their Law, as also by the honor of their Conscience: But forasmuch as <hi>Jesus Christ</hi> hath nothing common with <hi>Mahomet,</hi> and that the <hi>Pope</hi> and the <hi>Mufty</hi> hold <hi>Maximes</hi> directly opposite; I cannot comprehend how Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans believing in the Gospel should follow the <hi>Alcoran;</hi> I cannot so much as guesse at the reasons they can have, so cruelly to fall upon the
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:205168:171"/> slaughter of the life and liberty of their Brethren; nor do I know in what time, nor by the emission of what <hi>Angel</hi> they have obtained a dispensation of their first Laws, and a permission to violate Justice. In our Religion, Reason and Equity ought to be the bounds of the wills of <hi>Kings,</hi> as Rivers and Mountains are of their Kingdomes; They should put in the same ranke things unjust and impossible: And since it is no imperfection in God, that he cannot sin, so neither should it be in them a defect of power, that they cannot do evill. What ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is there that small faults should be punished, and great ones honored: That the Enormous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the Action should be that which authorizeth the Crime, and justifieth the Criminal; and that a poor Fellow who seeks only to get his living upon the Sea with one Bark, should be call'd a Pirate, and wish'd ill by every one; and that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:205168:172"/> who followes the same Trade with a puissant Navie should be an Emperor, and praised of all the world.</p>
               <p>Certainly there is no appearance of equity in it; And we ought ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely to reject the sentence of the Tragick Poet so often chanted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Theaters,</hi> and so familiar in the mouth of a Tyrant; That in matter of <hi>State,</hi> and to command, it is lawfull to violate right, but it must be observed in any thing else: Casting my eyes back upon this pretty sentence, and looking some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing neerer upon it, I find not much sense in it, and yet is it more absurd then dangerous. For if it be true, as they hold in these times, that other wickednesses are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in Tyrannie, as the lesser numbers in the greater, and that it is the ruine and dissolution of the body Politick; How is it possible to preserve one part of Justice, and to destroy the whole? To admit
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:205168:172"/> the accomplishment and the last degree of evill, and to exclude thence the Principles and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? To think to retain life at the end of a finger, when the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is already dead and fallen in pieces? Whoever speaks thus, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly hath no understanding, nor agrees with himself: He seems to defend something in shew, but grants all in effect, and saith, though it be not his intention to say it, that there must speciall care be had, not to be perjur'd or sacrilegious, or a Parricide severally, but that a man may be lawfully all three toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and so become Innocent by the excess and number of his faults.</p>

               <p>THe Ancient Idolaters, who had only some light guesses, and simple conjectures of true vertue, and who consequently were not
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:205168:173"/> tyed to so perfect an uprightness as we are, have condemned these Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall speeches before us. They tried, at least, to ground themselves upon Reason, when they set upon any People, and said not barely that the end of their Conquests was to conquer.</p>
               <p>It was an opinion generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived among the <hi>Greeks,</hi> that Warr was permitted against the <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians;</hi> whereof there were two sorts, and which they ordinarily se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated into two Classes: For though their vanity extended this word to all those that spake not their language, nor were governed according to their Customes, yet giving it sometimes a more strict and limited signification, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining it to fewer persons, they understood by it only the <hi>Medes,</hi> or the <hi>Persians,</hi> with whom they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes had dealing, or the furthest Nations of the world, who lived without Laws and discipline, in the
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:205168:173"/> ignorance and Infirmity of Nature not at all assisted by Education.</p>
               <p>Now it is very true, they had no great reason to love the former, because they were the Immortall Enemies of their name and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, which they had invaded many times with fire and sword, of which they had no constant and perpetuall design to render themselves Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, and who desired with all their power, that the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> might be adored by the <hi>Grecian Priests,</hi> and served by the <hi>Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monian</hi> slaves. Thus so high an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence pricked them on very lively, and the hatred they bore them was such, that in all their Assemblies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they deliberated of any thing, they publickly cursed him that should be of opinion they might make friendship or Alliance with them: And in their more solemnu Feasts, the <hi>Herauld</hi> had an express charge to declare them excommunicated, no less then homicides and sacrilegious
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:205168:174"/> persons, and to forbid all strangers in consideration of them, the use of holy things, and participation of their Mysteries.</p>
               <p>For the other <hi>Barbarians</hi> of whom I speak, they have so ill an opinion, and esteem them so little, that they will scarce believe them to be Men, or that they have a Soul wholly reasonable; At which I am not much astonished, since in our memory in the Schools of <hi>Spain</hi> they disputed, if the <hi>Indians</hi> were of the race of <hi>Adam,</hi> or were not a middle bastard species between a Man and an Ape. Be it then, that in their opinion they were not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures like themselves, they concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved they went only to hunt, and gave themselves to an honest exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise when they made warr against them; or be it that they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Men, though not very perfect nor compleat (besides that, both ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly &amp; prophane Philosophie do both agree, that the wise Man is by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:205168:174"/> Master of him that is not,) they imagined, that the right of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty exacted from them the ayds and succors which are due to persons that want them, and that they themselves should be <hi>Barbarians,</hi> if they had not pitty upon those who truly were so, and took not from them that vicious liberty which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained them in their brutish dispositions to the dishonour of Common nature. They did believe they used charity towards them to subject them to their Dominion, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that by their victory they polish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the rudeness of their manners; They taught them vertue which they had no knowledg of, and gave them good Laws in place of their ill Customes: Thus to some they brought the Invention of Arts, and shewed them the use of husbandry; others they drew from Caves to place them in Cities. Upon some they imposed Tribute, never more to sacrifice their Children; some
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:205168:175"/> they obliged to abstain from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane flesh, and to have respect to the bed of their <hi>Mothers</hi> and <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters,</hi> teaching them in the same time to use innocent meates and lawfull pleasures.</p>
               <p>But if this change could not be made by fair means, and if the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the Habite were such, that they must be constrain'd to be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, instead of being miserable: They said that all great Examples have something unjust in them, which are not to be considered in respect of the Universall good: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can deceit be called evill when it is profitable to him that is decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, nor violence deserve that name when it turns to the profit and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of him who is enforced. And as there are some things that surpasse Reason, which are not therefore unreasonable, especially in matters of Religion; So all that is above Justice, is not therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just, especially in acts of State:
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:205168:175"/> And to come to the worst, when their enterprize drew after it the greatest part of the vanquished, at least, their Children received the effect of the good intention of their Conquerors, in as much as they should be nourished in the feare of the Gods, and under the reverence of the Laws, and injoy the fruit which was presented to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
               <p>These are somewhat neer the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons upon which the <hi>Greeks</hi> might rest themselves in their Conquests. For the proceedings of the <hi>Romans</hi> we have couch'd them in part alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; But though they had all for their end, the greatness of their Empire, yet they were not so blinded with Avarice, nor so wedded to their own Interests, that through the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verses of profit, they did not see the beauty of true Glory; that they were not tempted with that pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion which at this day possesseth the <hi>King,</hi> and that sometimes they did
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:205168:176"/> not take up Armes for the Liberty of others.</p>
               <p>Can there be imagined a more generous decree, and more necessary to be renewed in this season, then that which was given by the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> at the instance of the Orator <hi>Demosthenes?</hi> See the substance of it in few words: When <hi>King Philip</hi> assaulted some places over which he had some right, the people of <hi>Athens</hi> did not conceive themselves obliged to intervene in that occasion, nor to meddle in a business that did not at all concern them: but now that <hi>Greece</hi> it self is assaulted, they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it a thing unworthy the glory of their Predecessors, who behold about them <hi>Grecian</hi> Cities which are not free: For this reason the Counsel and the People of <hi>Athens</hi> have judged it expedient to sacrifice to the Gods, and to the <hi>Tutelar Hero's</hi> of the Town and Countrey; and animated by the Generosity of their Ancestors, to whom the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:205168:176"/> Liberty hath alwayes bin dearer then the particular good of their Countrey; have ordained that there be set to Sea 200 Vessels, that the Admirall shall saile towards the <hi>Thermopyles,</hi> and the Generall by Land conduct his <hi>Cavalrie</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanterie</hi> towards <hi>Eleusina:</hi> That moreover Embassadors be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spatch'd towards the other free States of <hi>Greece,</hi> to fortifie them in the design which they ought to have to maintain their Liberty, to exhort them not to be terrified at the Threats of the Enemy, and to assure them that the <hi>Athenians</hi> are resolved to succor with Men, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, Armes, and Ammunition all those that <hi>Philip</hi> would oppress.</p>
               <p>After a long revolution of years, another <hi>Philip</hi> having the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign that the former had (so fatall is this name to the Publick <hi>Liberty</hi>) the <hi>Romanes</hi> proclaim'd Warr a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, and having overcome him, the Feast of the <hi>Istmian Games</hi>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:205168:177"/> falling by chance at that time, and being celebrated at <hi>Corinth,</hi> where there was present a great Concourse of People, they made Proclamation in a full <hi>Theater,</hi> of this that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the <hi>Generall Flaminius,</hi> having put the <hi>Macedonians</hi> and <hi>King Philip</hi> in their duty, declare; That their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention</hi> is, that all <hi>Greece</hi> live here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after according to the Laws, and understand particularly, that the <hi>Corinthians, Phocians, Locrians,</hi> Those of the Island of <hi>Euboea,</hi> the <hi>Magnetes, Perrhebes,</hi> and the <hi>Achaians</hi> of <hi>Phtia</hi> enjoy the same Immunities, Rights and Priviledges which they enjoyed before <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> had seised upon their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
               <p>And though some, to obscure the Lustre of this Action, will say, that the Liberty wherewith they presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, was rather an apparent and counterfeit Liberty, then true
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:205168:177"/> and solid; yet alwayes it was much to undertake a warr at their own cost, to better their condition who were nothing at all to them: It was extreamly to oblige them, to rescue them from slavery, though otherwise they left them in some kind of dependance toward their Protectors; It was not to entreat them ill, to ease them of a load un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which they sunk down, to give them a lesser burthen.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Romanes</hi> therefore took not all for themselves; Their ambition had some Rules and limits; and though their mind and their desires were vast, yet they were not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite. When <hi>Scipio</hi> the <hi>Censor</hi> made the <hi>Ceremony</hi> of the expired <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strum,</hi> and the <hi>Register</hi> was going to rehearse the usuall Prayer where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Gods were intreated to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the fortune of the People of <hi>Rome</hi> better and more powerfull then it was; It is good enough and great enough answered he: I only
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:205168:178"/> pray that it would please them to continue it to us; and ordain'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the place, that in the publick Acts they should correct the forme of the Prayer, which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was no otherwise reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: So that there was a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and a stop in the hearts of the most covetous and most ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romanes</hi> bore at least a respect to the Name of vertue; They did not openly make a mock of Right and Equity, and made profession not to take up Armes but in these three Cases; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to revenge Injuries received, or to defend themselves from oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, or to give Laws to them that had none, approving consequently no warrs but just, or necessary, or honest.</p>

               <p>GOod God! What resemblance is there with this in the present condition of the Affaires of <hi>Europe?</hi> What is there in the cause of the Conquerors of this Age, that a good <hi>Pagan</hi> can maintain, or that a good Christian dare excuse?</p>
               <p>I see I must once more impeach Tyranny, and pursue it to its inmost retreats, even into the heart of his Subjects, and see whether the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be more Innocent then the Counsel. The <hi>Germans,</hi> are they the same to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sians</hi> were to the <hi>Greeks?</hi> Have they almost over-run <hi>Galice</hi> or <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon?</hi> Have they pillaged the Churches of <hi>Madrid?</hi> Have they demanded Slaves from <hi>Castile?</hi> Besides, what right have the <hi>Castil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> over <hi>Montferrat?</hi> Do they take the People that inhabite the River <hi>Poe</hi> for Savages? Will they
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:205168:179"/> Civilize the <hi>Jtalians</hi> who keep a School of Gentility &amp; Gallantry, &amp; with whom for a long time all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties are grown old? They cannot make use of these pretences, nor im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the Colours of the <hi>Grecians</hi> to cover their Ambition, and to paint it with some shew of vertue: There is nothing but a desire to become Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of other mens Habitations, which makes them go out of their own; and this unhappie fancie of a Universal <hi>Monarchie</hi> which is put into their head, which hath made them undertake design upon design, and run after the least noise they perceive. In the midst of peace they have the spirit of Warr, and a seditious will; and when others think they are at rest, they plot only how they may be more active: The reasons of State Torment them day and night; They are leane and sick only for this: and their perpetuall yel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ownesse is an internal sign, and a violent impression of that
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:205168:179"/> Covetousnesse to reign, which burns and consumes them within.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gonsolva</hi> of <hi>Corduba,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> are indeed dead, but their Counsels and their Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons live still: They yet lay Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bushes to freedome and credulity; They yet oppress <hi>Princes,</hi> and make Warr against the liberty of the People. The Children do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate from their Parents; They are as subtle Interpreters of their Treaties; They are as little scrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the observation of the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faith: They use their Religion after the same manner: They swear as boldly upon the Gospels and the Altars all that they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd not to performe.</p>
               <p>For all this we must render an entire Testimony to truth, and do equitie even to injustice it self. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> are a People of no small Reputation; They are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for many good qualities, and their very vices are specious
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:205168:180"/> and carrie a kind of lustre with them. That Idlenesse which was punished at <hi>Athens,</hi> is honored in <hi>Spain,</hi> which remains desart and barren in many places for want of hands to Till and husband it. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists in that Countrey are ashamed of their Trade; They exercise it in secret, as a thing forbidden, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in publick with their swords by their sides: They account them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves all Gentlemen, and they all speak like Courtiers and Counsel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors of State; The meanest Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gesse hath the same thoughts with the Constable of <hi>Castile;</hi> They never bemoane the misery of their condition, because they believe they have a share in the greatness of their Master: There is no man holds himself poor, when he but thinks of the <hi>Mines</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> and who seeks not in the publick happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the content which he cannot find in his own particular fortune. I would to God we were as good

                  <hi>French-men,</hi> as they are good <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards;</hi> and that we loved our Countrey with as much passion as they do theirs.

               <p>Their Fidelity begins not now to be known, it hath bin praised by the Testimony of Antiquitie, and it is written of them, that Torments have not bin able to draw out of their mouthes, their Masters, or Friends secrets. That Slave is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently famous, who after he had revenged his Benefactor, began to laugh when they put him to exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and with calme joy mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Executioners and all their inventions of Cruelty. But what reputation can equall the vertue of <hi>Flexio,</hi> and what so honorable mention can be made by Historie which will not come short of his merit! King <hi>Sanches,</hi> against whom his Brother <hi>Alphonso</hi> made Warr, had placed him in <hi>Conimbra</hi> to defend it. This faithfull Servant, after he had bin a long time nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rished with Leather and Urine, and had constantly indured all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences of a Siege, would not for all this surrender himself, nor
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:205168:181"/> give up the Town to the power of <hi>Alphonso,</hi> though his Brother <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches</hi> were dead. He would not trust any thing that could be said to him thereof; and continued in this vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous incredulity, till he was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to go to <hi>Toledo</hi> where his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster was buried; whose Tombe being opened to him, he put the Keyes of the place between his hands.</p>
               <p>For their Abstinence and sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, it is almost incredible that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of them; every hearbe serves them for meat, all juyce serves them for oyle, all liquor is wine; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we see not among them fat and corpulent persons.: In one <hi>Swisse</hi> there is enough to make three <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards;</hi> Their foul swims not in the blood, nor is stifled by the flesh and fatness of their body; they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes content with a very slender nourishment: In the time of <hi>Pliny,</hi> their choice dishes were Acorns rosted in the embers; Now with a Raddish or bunch of Fennell
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:205168:182"/> they are twice 24 houres in a facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; They die of hunger, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over those that make good cheare.</p>
               <p>Behold what is worthily esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongst them: But what means is there to indure their pride which they bring into the world with them? This second originall sin, in which they are conceived; This essentiall property by which they are <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as by Reason Men; They generally condemne whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is not of their own Countrey, nor can they believe, that out of it there is any thing fair, or valiant, or Catholique; They look upon other people with pity, and though <hi>Spain</hi> be the Mother but of few Children, and that she adopts the <hi>Walloons,</hi> the <hi>Germanes,</hi> and the <hi>Italians,</hi> with which she fils her Armies, yet they cease not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn these Nations by whom they are formidable, and to call them <hi>Veillacos,</hi> who make them to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:205168:182"/> and bear rule.</p>
               <p>Is it not a pleasure to hear them say sometimes, that their Army consists of 30 thousand Men, and 5000 Souldiers, that is, of 30 thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Strangers, and 5000 <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards?</hi> and to see these braggado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cioes renew the vanitie of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Princes,</hi> who made a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between their Confederates and their Souldiers, nor ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated this last name to their <hi>Auxiliaries</hi> which they took to the warr with them.</p>
               <p>They are indeed, more truly then the <hi>Romanes,</hi> Robbers of all Lands, and Pyrats of all Seas: Their am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is not content with the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of visible things; It search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after an unknown worid. It hath penetrated, as it were, to a new nature: And if they were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that those great spots which appear in the body of the <hi>Moone,</hi> were <hi>Provinces</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes;</hi> as <hi>Galileus</hi> would perswade them,
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:205168:183"/> they would find out a way to go thither.</p>
               <p>But let us mock at the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancie of their designs, when they are indeed extravagant and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous. Let not us our selves speak of businesses far off, though uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Justice extends it self through all, and binds all men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; Let us leave the Interest of Common humanity to take care of our particular; let us complain of the Evils of <hi>Europe,</hi> and not bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie our selves to tell the History of the <hi>Indians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Kings,</hi> it seems, doe him wrong to be Soveraigns, and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular States offend him in being Free. As long as he shall have one neighbour, there wil never want fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling out: Either by good will or by force he will enter upon all the affaires of <hi>Princes:</hi> When they come as Compeeres, they carry themselves like Enemies; They change the offices which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:205168:183"/> into evill rights which they alleadge, and false debts which they demand: And if two Concurrents pretend to one thing, the Temper which they find to content them, is to take it from them: Thus they accommodate differences, and unite Parties, by putting them out of their Interest: They have played such games in <hi>Germany,</hi> and would continue them in <hi>Italy;</hi> they have matter ready to fall to work else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; and though their enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses go sometimes but slowly on, and that the success follow not close up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the resolution, yet we alwaies see in them a strange obstinacy to hope well.</p>
               <p>They are no longer before <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zal,</hi> but if I mistake not, they will not stay long before they return thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: They are not repulsed neither by the length nor difficulty of things; That which they cannot do to day, they imagine they shall do to morrow: If they are abus'd in
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:205168:184"/> the Termes, they believe to be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sur'd of the Event. Already they deliberate of the order which they wil establish in the affaires of peace, after the victory: Already they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign Governors for places which they intend to besiege next year, and think so insolently of the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that there wants but little of beleaguring their Debters upon the taking of <hi>Venice:</hi> And certainly, if God had not put barrs in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome against their violence, and a place of freedome for weakness; If <hi>France</hi> were not the common Countrey of strangers, and if our Armies were not the defensive Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Christendome; I doubt not but they would sooner or later finish the Conquests which they have begun, and at last carry away the Crown from <hi>Italy,</hi> upon which they have fastened so many assaults.</p>

               <p>YEt let the <hi>Italians</hi> rest assur'd if they are affrighted; let them conceive a firme hope from the day of their safety which is coming on; let them prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to receive the good fortune which comes to find them: There is yet of their Race who have cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stised their Tyrants, who have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their Provinces from divers plagues that afflicted them; Who have ruined the Empire of the <hi>Lombards</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> and restor'd the Soveraign High Preists to their Seat: The Successor of <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maigne</hi> is alive, and asks only their consent to take the yoak from off their neck, who stretcheth forth his hands to the Potentates that are fallen from their Thrones, who finds himself offended wherever they offend Justice, and beares his cares and his thoughts every where,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:205168:185"/> where there are honest men that suffer, or weak men that groan.</p>
               <p>But let them also consider, if they please, that all alone he cannot do all things, and that in vain he hath the power to make Warr, if they have not the courage to make use of these Remedies, but cherish their disease. God who hath made us without us, will not save us without us; He will have us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute something on our part to our own preservation, and to be as it were Co-workers together with him; He will have us take paines at his work, and that we be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of that business whereof he is the undertaker. Upon what therefore dream these Speculatives in the Countrey of <hi>Machiavell</hi> and <hi>Tacitus?</hi> What do those <hi>Princes</hi> and People pretend to become, who will behold us with their armes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crosse? If they performe not what was promised; Do they think to be idle Spectators, and umoveable
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:205168:185"/> in an Action, whose success is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to them by an inevitable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence? Do they believe this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faire is indifferent to them, because the first troubles and the first dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers seem particularly to belong to the <hi>Monsier</hi> of <hi>Mantua?</hi> Are they not afraid that the contagion of the evill passeth even to them, and that the ruine of others draws theirs after it? Do they not know that we receive all the blows which are given to our Countrey, and that all her wounds are ours? That they disarme us in spoiling our Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and weaken our Towns in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those of our Neighbours? What Fatall and miserable stupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is this? Have they not eies to see the Firebrands that are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to burne <hi>Germany?</hi> Is not the noise which the fall of the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latinate</hi> hath made, able to waken them? Shall that be said of the <hi>Jtalians,</hi> which was said of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Asia,</hi> That for Freemen they
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:205168:186"/> were worth nothing, but made Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Slaves, and upheld an insup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable Tyranny, for want of knowing how to say No, and not being able stedfastly to pronounce this Syllable.</p>
               <p>Because they are not yet op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press'd, and that they are reserved for the last Act of the Tragedy, they believe They are secure; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the poyson hath not yet gain'd their heart, and death doth not yet gripe them, they imagin they are very well: And because the <hi>Spaniard</hi> is not yet sate down before their Cities with his Troops, they sweare he doth not so much as dream of them. And yet if one of their Citizens should provide great store of Stones, very much Wood, Lime and Sand, and such like materialls, and at the same time prepare a place in a very faire scate to imploy all these things, they would say without doubt that he built and erected a Pallace, though
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:205168:186"/> they saw not the Foundations laid, nor the Wals set up: Why therfore will they not say, that the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> who heaps together his preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with so long a hand to reach them, I meane his best and dearest Friends, makes Warr upon them now, though he hath not yet besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, nor bid them Battle? Why will they not in a good time, put the State in a posture to defend it self; seeing if they suffer him to manage his work till it be done, it will be no longer in their power to oppose him? Forasmuch as all his peace is deceitfull, and disguised; his Friendship proud and violent; Seeing his Complements intreate not, but command and compel, and that it is impossible to live in good correspondence with him, and in Liberty; They must of necessity chuse the one of two things, either to be his Subjects, or his Enemies, and see which they love best, Slavery or Warr.</p>
               <pb n="296" facs="tcp:205168:187"/>
               <p>Things are not so altered in their Countrey, but Nature hath preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved some remainder of good seed; she can yet raise up Spirits stout and couragious from this ancient principle of Valour, which is not as yet extinguished, and distill some drops of bloud purely <hi>Romane</hi> and <hi>Jtalian,</hi> amidst that corrupted masse it labours under.</p>
               <p>It cannot be but sometimes they remember they are the Children of the Lords of the Universe, and that their Fathers have triumphed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly over <hi>Spain.</hi> It cannot be but having among them so many <hi>Caesars, Pompeyes, Scipios,</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>millusses,</hi> they should be ashamed to beare these great Names, and obey in the meane time a <hi>Don Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,</hi> or a <hi>Don Pedro.</hi> It is a shame indeed that for all the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berations at <hi>Milan</hi> and <hi>Naples,</hi> they must expect the resolution from <hi>Madrid,</hi> and that the <hi>Jtalians</hi> should remaine at the lowest <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="297" facs="tcp:205168:187"/> of slavery, where the poor groomes without ever seeing the face of their Master, are obedient to other Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants? It is a great shame that they should imploy their Eloquence to flatter Tyrants, which they ought to make use of to excite peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to recover their Liberty: It is a shame that they are Active and Valiant only for another, and that their Spirit and their Courage should take pains, only to streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then a Dominion that oppresseth them.</p>
               <p>If they do good actions in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and in the <hi>Low-Countries,</hi> if they return from Warr charged with spoiles, and full of reputation, it is the <hi>Spaniards</hi> glory, and not theirs: by that they do not gain Subjects, but Companions of slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie: They make not the fortune of their own Countrey better, but render the power of a stranger more formidable; Their chains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more glittering and strong,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:205168:188"/> not lighter and more loose.</p>
               <p>I hope they will make some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection hereupon, and that I shall not lose all that I have said; Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps that vertue which is believed dead, is but asleep; perhaps the sick will get up, and the heart re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from its swoonings.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Republick</hi> of <hi>Venice,</hi> without doubt, will cast its eyes upon that Decree of <hi>Athens</hi> which was not upheld by a <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> when it proclaim'd warr against <hi>King Philip;</hi> She will adde sharpness to her prudence, and will arme good Counsels, lest <hi>Fury</hi> should be more strong then <hi>Reason;</hi> She will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companie more then ever with Courage and generositie, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent wisdome, whereof she reads Lectures to all <hi>Europe:</hi> She will consider, that having bin born and brought up in the Armes of Liberty, and calling her self <hi>Queen</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> she should very much degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; if in her old age she should
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:205168:188"/> change her condition, and upon firme Land quit her <hi>Scepter</hi> and her <hi>Diadem.</hi> She will consider, that her incomparable scituation which seems rather a Miracle, and an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Divine power, then a work of mens hands: Her sump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous <hi>Arsenal,</hi> her proud <hi>Haven,</hi> and her stately buildings, are not the fruits of the fear and laziness of their Ancestors; but the effects of their labour, their Sweats and their Constancie: and all these illustrious marks, cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served but by those means whereby they were acquir'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>His Holinesse</hi> hath a Soul too noble, and too high to do any low thing in this occasion; The perfect knowledg of Divine and humane things, which even the Enemies to his Church admire in him; the commerce which he hath with the Ancient <hi>Romans,</hi> whose writings breath nothing but libertie and love of their Countrey; The abode he
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:205168:189"/> made in <hi>France,</hi> where he had most particular Conference with <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and entred long before into his mind and thoughts: Lastly, that aspect worthy of an <hi>Empire,</hi> which sheweth something more then humane; and that counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance which casteth beams of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestie</hi> upon all that behold it, signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth nothing fearfull or feeble, and can furnish us with none but good presages and fair hopes. He will take the pains to remember, that his dignitie hath bin more respected by <hi>Attila</hi> then by <hi>Charles,</hi> and that the only presence of <hi>Leo</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, stop'd the scourge of God and chas'd him out of <hi>Italy;</hi> Whereas this Devout and Religious <hi>Prince,</hi> after 3 Treaties of <hi>Peace</hi> wherewith he held <hi>Clement</hi> the seventh in a sleep, kept him Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner contrary to all Divine and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane right, and sack'd <hi>Rome</hi> by the hands of the <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He will see in the Historie of his
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:205168:189"/>
                  <hi>Predecessors,</hi> that for a less danger then that which threatens him, they have heretofore made a Holy warr against <hi>Mainfroy,</hi> as against the <hi>Sultan;</hi> and that another time they have sent forth a <hi>Croisade</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those of <hi>Cullen,</hi> after the same manner as against the Infidels.</p>
               <p>But if he will be a better mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of his <hi>Thunders,</hi> and make use of his power more moderately; If for some Respects he will not open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrace the Common cause, nor assist with his Armes interessed <hi>Princes;</hi> I assure my self at least, that he will favour them with his Inclination, his vows and wishes; and will blesse their affaires secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>And since we have an opinion, that a <hi>Friend</hi> or <hi>Master</hi> that sees us play, though he say not a word, nor speak upon the game, leaves not to assist us, and to bring ill luck to our Adversaries: They will grow somewhat bold of the good will of
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:205168:190"/> the <hi>Pope,</hi> though neither published nor declar'd; and will take courage from the signs he shall make them, if they cannot prevaile by his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
               <p>For other inferior <hi>Princes,</hi> whose repose is not founded upon the holiness of Religion, and like him cannot command the world in a <hi>Chaire;</hi> it is necessary that they stirr wholly for the recoverie or preservation of their Crowns, and that they enter into the design which the <hi>King</hi> hath to re-establish them if they are depos'd, or to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them if they are threatned: It is necessary that they cry to them on high, that <hi>Liberty</hi> is not defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Feare,</hi> nor is violence repel'd with softness.</p>
               <p>It is needfull, that in this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Italy, Germany,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>Catholiques,</hi> the <hi>Protestants,</hi> and the <hi>Arminians,</hi> should unite themselves together against the Common Enemie; against him who
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:205168:190"/> assaults not the <hi>Hereticks</hi> out of zeal of Religion, but Interest of <hi>State,</hi> and who covets not as St. <hi>Paul</hi> did, the Unbelievers, but those things which are theirs. A <hi>Stoick</hi> and an <hi>Epicure,</hi> that is to say, two men who make profession of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary <hi>Philosophie;</hi> and who were of two dis-agreeing <hi>Sects,</hi> could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree when there was a question of delivering their Countrey from sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie, and could lay their opinions aside to joyn their Interests toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>A man that is in danger to be drown'd, catcheth hold indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of whatever he meets with, were it a naked sword, or a hot iron. Necessity divides Brothers and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites Strangers; It makes the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian agree with the <hi>Turk</hi> against the Christian; It excuseth and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth whatever it doth: The Law of God hath not abrogated the law of nature; The preservation of a mans self is the most pressing, if
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:205168:191"/> not the most lawfull of all Duties. In an extream danger we look not so neer to fair dealing, or what may seem best; neither is to sin, but to defend a mans self with the left hand.</p>

               <p>Those very advantages he so much braggs of, are victories so dearly bought, that he had bin ruin'd, had he gain'd many such; For his losses they are notable and ordinary, and some of them he will feel yet a long time; At the <hi>Hague</hi> is to be seen a great Hall all Tapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred with his Cloaths, In which the States feasted <hi>Marquesse Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nola,</hi> when of a Captain Generall he became an Embassador to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand peace, and the Eternall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell acknowledg'd its Subjects for

The <hi>Germans</hi> will be free
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:205168:194"/> when ever they shall please to break their Fetters: The Division cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing amongst them, the power of the <hi>Spaniard</hi> will cease to be in their Countrey, and the first day that they shall agree together, He will be driven out.</p>
               <p>I hear talk moreover of a King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> which can very well give him his handfull, and do exceeding service, if he be advisedly imployed. His Courage is not a blind and headlong boldnesse, nor his Valour a heat of anger: He knows who to make Warr with knowledg, and leaves scarce any thing to the discretion of Fortune. The moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his soul are very high, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so they are very regular and just; He hath a great spirit guided by a greater judgement; He hath the possession of necessary vertues, nor doth he want those that are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull; He would deserve a Kingdome neerer the Sun then that of <hi>Swedland:</hi> And if <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> who
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:205168:194"/> named the <hi>Romans</hi> Barbarous, should returne again into the world, he would certainly say, that never was <hi>Greek</hi> more accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor more rationall then this <hi>Barbarian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> wil not abandon a cause in the which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the reasons of State which are common to him with us, his Honor and his Conscience will ingage him more particularly then any other; He wil have pitty of his Sister, of his Brother in Law, and of his Nephewes, which are sad and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable Examples of the instabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the things of the World; and which may be added to the <hi>Adrastes,</hi> the <hi>Polynices,</hi> the <hi>Hecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas</hi> and <hi>Antigones</hi> upon the Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Now that he is rid of that Importunate, who traversed all his good designes, and who play'd so insolently with his name and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the pernicious Galentries of his State; being as he is wise and
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:205168:195"/> Noble, he will undertake a Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion worthy his good sence and Courage. He will hearken to that faire <hi>Queen</hi> whom Heaven hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him, full of spirit and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, that in the same person he may find together all content and assistance, and that she that posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his love, and who is the delight of his eies, may participate also in his Counsels, and be the Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his cares. He will follow his first Inclinations, and his true Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests, nor will he lightly depart from the ancient Amities of the late <hi>King</hi> her Father; and remembring the disgusts which were offered him he will joyn himself with <hi>France</hi> where he was intreated with all kind of honor and affection. This good cause will be upheld by other meanes; nor will want followers and partners; besides it is certain that the Body which we are afraid of, hath its wounds and infirmities which trouble it, and which leave
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:205168:195"/> not off to be dangerous, though they be covered with some appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of health; Neither need we doubt that Warr beginning to seize upon it, and to presse him on all sides, he will not presently be sensible of whatever pain or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is in his members, and under that bundle and paint of Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, which cheats the world, there be not found some corrupted parts and incurable ulcers. But let the worst come; when he shall be as sound as he seems great and strange, when he shall have quitted himself of all his losses, who shall be his Surety for the future? If he hath prospered since the death of the late <hi>King,</hi> 'tis his turne now to be mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; if he grow secure of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Fortune, he confides in the Caresses of a Curtezan: It is not likely that she that makes profession of lightnesse, should be constant for the love of him; But it is very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the groanes of Nations, the
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:205168:196"/> clamor of Innocents persecuted, the affliction of Mothers and Widowes left desolate; The Violations, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegies and other ill consequences, of unjust Warrs, will mount up to the very Throne of God, and will draw down his vengeance upon him that is the cause of so many mischiefs. There is much more likelyhood that the eternall Justice prepares that punishment for him which he deserves, rather then that Fortune, which is but a Infidel, should keep her word with him, If God understand the cry of the young Ravens in their nest, will he not hear his Children who sollicite him, and demand a reason of the wrong which is done them? If the voice of the bloud of <hi>Abel</hi> came up to him, shall the bloud of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Christians be dumbe, and fall to the ground without making any noise? Shall their complaints, their imprecations, their last words be lost? Shall they die for Justice,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:205168:196"/> and yet Justice make no enquirie after their death? The avenger of Perjuries and of violated Religion, will he alwaies suffer Religion to be made an instrument for Tyranny, and that that name should be made use of to deceive the world? If he count our hairs, will he have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to our sighs? Will he not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther up our Tears? Will he despise our Prayers? No, No, let us assure our selves that God is for us, and that the miseries of Christendome do touch him. We have one marke, concerning the certainty whereof it is not lawfull to doubt: If he had not resolved powerfully to succour those that are his, He had not sent the <hi>King</hi> at this time; If he had not a desire to make them overcome, he had not presented them with so brave a Captain; If he would deferr the tearm of their Liberty, he would have deferr'd his birth. Certainly he hath caused this excellent <hi>Prince</hi> to be borne
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:205168:197"/> for the good of men, and for the happinesse of his Age. He hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him to the Prayers of <hi>France,</hi> of <hi>Jtaly,</hi> and of <hi>Germany,</hi> who have beg'd him; He could not refuse the necessity of his people that had need of him. The Captain Generall of a great Confederacie, who should have spent the greatest part of his life, in Closets and Gardens, and who had seen nothing but Masks and Feasts, would be overcome by the first ill news; and the hope of them who should rest themselves upon his capacity, would have a very weak and ruinous Foundation; But this <hi>Man</hi> is born amidst Warr and Armies: From his Infancy he hath beheld Sieges and Battles; Necessity hath hardned him in good time for vertue, and that which is troublesome to others, is only an Exercise to him: There is nothing so high nor so difficult, but we may expect it from his Valour; He will go beyond our highest hopes. I
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:205168:197"/> will say once more; It depends on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of himself that he doth not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, and dispute his Empire and Dominion with the most Ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: But He will not enrich him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with publike losses: Nor will he be guiltie of his good Fortune, he desires not a quality which should prove Tragicall to all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> Let no man take any distaste at his designes, nor let his Armes be an occasion of Jealousie to any one. He hath consecrated his hands to the Lord, and to the Protection of Justice; His armes defend none but good Causes; They bring rest and security to People, and will be in the same condition, as the <hi>Targets</hi> that fell from Heaven were to the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes</hi> that gathered them up. It is not <hi>Hanniball</hi> that comes down from the <hi>Alps</hi> with all the cruelties and perfidious dealings of his Countrey, and that, after a solemn Oath to destroy <hi>Jtaly.</hi> It is <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin,</hi> it is <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> who will
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:205168:198"/> once more deliver them; and if in the fatall year that That <hi>African</hi> began his Warr, a Child being out of his Mothers belly return'd presently back again, to shew that he could not do well in the world in so ill a time; Now that a time quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this begins, certainly it will be a pleasure to be borne an Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant of the earth; And Mothers ought to be glad of their fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, because they are sure to bear Children that shall be happier then their Fathers, and who shall live in Liberty by the benefit of <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Just.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He need not be suspected of the <hi>Italians,</hi> nor ought <hi>Italy</hi> to account him for a stranger; He is an <hi>Italian</hi> by the Mothers side, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently interessed in the present af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires, not only by honour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of State, but also out of a naturall Inclination and Piety; and because they will needs tell us false Oracles, and supposititious Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies:
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:205168:198"/> Since <hi>Pythia</hi> is still a lyar in favour of <hi>Philip,</hi> why should not we search out Oracles of our side, and make use of the witness of wise men, who, according to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> are never without Divine Inspiration?</p>
               <p>Why should not we alleadg that which was written above a hundred years ago by a great Person, to <hi>Laurence de Medicis,</hi> Duke of <hi>Ʋrbin;</hi> that miserable <hi>Italy</hi> should hope from his house for one that should deliver it. Infallibly the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that dictated these words to him, saw afar off the marriage of <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Great;</hi> he intended to speak of <hi>Lewis the Just,</hi> and desig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the wonders which we have seen, and those which we shall see, if the <hi>Italians</hi> will not obstinately resist their own good fortune, and preferr not their Onions and their Garlick, (I mean some small In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests and beggarly pensions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with <hi>Spain</hi> repaies them) before the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:205168:199"/> Liberty which is offered to them.</p>
               <p>But be it as it will, the <hi>King</hi> hath a design to do that which the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> have done, whom History hath made mention of for Demy-Gods: He goes in the steps of those mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous <hi>Kings,</hi> the sworn Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of wicked men, the Protectors of honest men, the peace-makers of Sea and Land, who seek for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fruit from their victories but the rest of the world, nor run from one end to another of it, but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure its deliverance. He knows that he is descended from those that have broken the forces, and extinguished the <hi>Tyranny</hi> of <hi>Luitprand, Astulph</hi> and <hi>Didier:</hi> from those who have restored to the <hi>Popes</hi> all <hi>Flaminia</hi> and <hi>Emilia,</hi> which had bin usurped from them: who presented them with the Isle of <hi>Corsa,</hi> and the Dutchie of <hi>Spoleto</hi> and <hi>Beneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum;</hi> who added to their Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, all the Countrey between <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi> and <hi>Lucqua:</hi> He knoweth that
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:205168:199"/> he is heire to him, who, by a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Title then that of <hi>Constantine's,</hi> might be called the <hi>Churches Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor,</hi> and whose name is yet read at <hi>Ravenna</hi> in a Table of <hi>Marble,</hi> with this remainder of an Inscripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>He was the first that opened the way to the growth and encrease of the Church.</hi> He believes with <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle,</hi> that to do well, is no less a mark of Excellency then of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and with St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that we must do good to all men, but chiefly to those of the houshold of faith; He believes that a great <hi>King</hi> ought to carry his cares long before into the future, and farr beyond his own Kingdome; that all times ought to be in like consideration with him as the present, and all miserable men equally recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him as his own Subjects: That <hi>Mountferrat</hi> and <hi>Mantua</hi> must be as neer to his mind as the Suburbs of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the back-side of the <hi>Louver;</hi> and if thirty daies
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:205168:200"/> journey from him, a poor afflicted Person invoke his name, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his Justice, he presently feels a diminution of his miseries, and a change in his fortune. He finds that it is a much fairer thing to restore Liberty to Common-Wealths, then to give them a good <hi>Master;</hi> to get passionate servants, rather then ill-affected Subjects; to make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self friends then vassals; to have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all men a Superioritie of vertue, rather then a Soveraignty of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: Lastly, he is not exalted to the highest degree of humane things, but that he may be looked upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farr off, and give lustre to the whole Kingdome, that he may serve for a rule to other <hi>Princes,</hi> for a living and animated Law to all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Earth.</p>
               <p>In Conscience since People of this sort make way where ever they pass, since their Example is a kind of Command, which the most rebellious cannot disobey, and that
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:205168:200"/> the bitterness which is sometimes found in vertue, is sweetned by the fondness of imitating <hi>Kings</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; the present Generation must needs become better experienced, and there would be too much hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in the hearts of men, if present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly all Christendome do not become vertuous, and if the Holy life of the Kings, without convocating the Generall States, and Assembly of Nobles, do not produce a voluntary Reformation in this State, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad an honest emulation to do as well as us.</p>
               <p>We need not any more seek for the <hi>Idea</hi> of a <hi>Prince</hi> in the Institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> nor go any more to <hi>Rome</hi> to admire the <hi>Statuas</hi> of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suls</hi> and <hi>Emperors,</hi> nor to praise the dead to the prejudice of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. There is not among all that People, any Antick piece of stone or brass, which represents a <hi>Heros</hi> like ours; we possess what our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers wished for, nor can we remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:205168:201"/> any thing which is of so much value, as what we have seen. As for me, whether it is that I am passio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate for the glory of my <hi>Master,</hi> or whether I interess my self in the design which I have undertaken, or that the light of present things daz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth me, or that the only love of Truth makes me speak; it is certain, that having beheld all the parts of the world, and considered it from the first moment of its birth, I find not any man, over whom the <hi>King</hi> hath not some advantage, nor any ones life, which take it altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is so admirable as his.</p>
               <p>I see great vertues in many pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but I see also great vices which accompany them: Serpents are hid under the Flowers; Poysons and perfumes come out of the same bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some of the Earth: whole Nature is a confusion of good and evill; there is not any part but suffers its inconveniences and wants; and those very bodies which it hath brought
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:205168:201"/> forth with the greatest care, and which it hath formed of the richest matter, have their Eclipses and their maladies: There is but the Person of the <hi>King,</hi> where I observe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I would not have to be: I am not here busied, as it were, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t the refining of mettals, to sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the pure from the impure; I am not troubled to sever vertue from vice.</p>
               <p>All there is equally good, all is blameless, and worthy to be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And if the first rank which he holds now amongst men, were to be disputed among them, I cannot suppose that any one could lawfully contend with him, but would yield to him either in nobleness of blood, or in prosperity of success, or in the carriage of his body, or in strength of wit, or in magnanimity of heart, or in uprightness of conscience.</p>
               <p>Let us conclude then, that he is <hi>The Prince</hi> by excellency, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all comparison; that his life is
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:205168:202"/> the lesson of <hi>Masters,</hi> and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the perfect, that his prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses ought to be the exercises of all wits, and the matter of all dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>
               <p>Let us not go out of so pleasant a meditation, but to enter into it again; Let us not take breath, but to lift our voices higher; let us not make an end but to begin again; So much Holy-day is there in all this <hi>Province,</hi> since the taking of <hi>Rochel;</hi> and we have leisure which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not better imploy, then to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of him who hath given it us, and who makes us in joy, in rest, our books and our studies. Besides that, when leisure it self failes us; and that businesses and affaires press us on all sides, so noble a digression deserveth to be preferred before bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesses and imployments.</p>
